alternation of distinct cytological generations is clearest in plants
"such as ferns and some algae, where the two generations (game-"
tophyte and sporophyte) are independent and either identical in
appearance (alteration of isomorphic generations) or quite dissimilar
(alternation of heteromorphic generations). In mosses and _ liverworts 4
the dominant (vegetative) plant is the gametophyte while the ca
sporophyte (the capsule) is more or less nutritionally dependent on the :
"gametophyte. In flowering plants, the male (micro-) and female ba"
"(macro-}) gametophytes are reduced to microscopic proportions, the -"
male gametophyte being shed as the pollen grain and the female
gametophyte (embryo sac) being retained on the sporophyte in the
ovule. A clearcut alternation of physically distinct plants is avoided
"here, although alternating cytological phases are still discemible. In"
"vascular plants generally, the sporophyte generation is the vegetative"
"plant itself be it a fem, herb, shrub or tree."

"fusing to form the amnion surrounding the embryo, and the CHORION"

". surrounding the amnion, ALLANTOTS and vorx SAC. The amnion"
usually expands to meet the chorion. In humans and many other mam-
imals the amnion originates by rolling up of some of the cells of the
INNER CELL mass during GASTRULATION. Amniotic fluid
(amounting to about one dm} at birth in humans) is circulated in
"placental mammals by foetal swallowing, enabling wastes ‘to pass to"
the placenta for removal. Provides a buffering cushion against mech-

ANTIBODY (IMMUNOGLOBULIN). Class of glycoprotein produced by
"vertebrate white blood cells (= + cms s), after maturation into plasma"
cells. Their main function is to bind highly selectively to foreign
"molecules (antigens), which then clump together (agglutinate) so that"
phagocytic white cells can engulf them.

Five major classes differ principally in their type of heavy protein
"chain, and the degree to which. the molecule is a polymer of im-"
munoglobulin ‘monomers’. Each immunoglobulin unit comprises two
identical H- (heavy) and two identical L- (light) polypeptide chains
forming mirror images of each other’ amd joumed! by a flexible hinge
region involving disulphide bridges. They bind to antigen at specific
antigen-binding regions provided uniquely by the combination of
H- and L-chain amino-terminal portions (see Fig. 1); which are

extremely variable in their amino acid sequences between different
"antibodies, in contrast to constant regions at their carboxy-terminal"
portions. Only about 20-30 amino acids of the variable regions of H- .
"and L-chains contribute to the antigen-binding site, these being"
located in three short hypervariable regions of each variable region.
These lie themselves within relatively invariant ‘framework regions’

 

 

 

 
 

34 ANTIBODY DIVERSITY

 

of the variable regions. The other biological properties of the molecule
are determined by the constant domains of the heavy chains.
Digestion of_antibody with papain produces two identical Fab

(antigen-binding) fragments and one Fc (crystallizing) fragment. The
latter region in the intact Ig (immunoglobulin) molecule is responsible
for determining which component of the immune system the antibody
will bind to. The Fe region of IgG may bind phagocytes and the first
component of compremanr. Only the IgG antibody can cross the
mammalian placenta. IgM is the major Ig type secreted in a primary
"immune — response, ae dominates in secondary immune responses"

 

(see  B-CELL).

"Transformation , of Becells into differentiated antibody-producing"
plasma cells generally requires both antigen-presenting cells and a
"signal from a helper T-cell (sce r< = 1 L), Because B-cells have only a"
a few days’ life in culture they are not suitable for commercial
"antibody production: however, if an antibody-producing B-cell from"
an appropriately immunized mouse is fused to an appropriate mutant
"tumour B-cell, the hybrid cell formed may continue dividing and"
producing the particular antibody required. The resulting ay -
"et p o » a can be sub-cloned indefinitely, giving large amounts of"
antibody. Initial isolation of the appropriate B-cell follows discovery
"of the required antibody in the growing medium, The purity of the"
resulting monoclonal antibody and its production in response to
what is possibly a minor component of an impure antigen mixture
are both desirable features of the technique. Seean tte Onyd werRe

"Aorta. Term applied to some major vertebrate arteries. See aorra,"
"DORSAL; AORTA, VENTRAL; AORTICARCH."

"Aorta, pvorsat. Major vertebrate (and cephalochordate) artery"
"through which blood passes to much of body, supplying arteries to"
most major organs. In sharks a single dorsal aorta collects oxygenated
"blood from the gills, but in bony fish paired dorsal aortae on either"
side in the head region perform this task before uniting as a single
median vessel. Oxygenated blood then passes backwards to the body;
but in fish too blood flowing up through the third AoR mc A Reo a
tends to pass anteriorly through the aorta(e) rather than posteriorly
"(see carorzp arrery). In adult tetrapods, those parts of the"
"single or paired dorsal, aortae between the third and fourth aortic"
"arches tend to disappear, blood from the fourth (systemic) arch(es)"
"passing back within two uniting dorsal aortae (terrestrial salamanders,"
"lizards) or within a single dorsal aorta (most reptiles, birds and"
mammals) derived from the right arch (reptiles and birds) and from
the left arch (mammals). Protected throughout in vertebrates by
proximity of bone above (typically vertebrae).

"AorTA, VENTRAL. Large median artery of fish and embryonic amniotes"
"leading anteriorly from ventricle of heart, either giving off branches"
to gills or running uninterrupted as aorrt c arcuzs to dorsal
"aorta(e). In lungfish, branches differ in this respect. In living am-"
"phibians it has disappeared, while in other tetrapods it serves merely"
"as a channel supplying blood to aortic arches II, IV and VI"

"AorTIC arches. Paired arteries (usually 6, but up to 15 in hagfishes) of"
vertebrate embryos connecting ventral aorta with dorsal aorta(e} by
"running up between gill slits or gill pouches on each side, one in each"
visczeratae ce. The study of their comparative anatomy in embryos
"and, where they persist, in adults provides striking support for"
"macroevolutionary change. Each is given a Roman numeral, beginning"
"anteriorly. Arches I and Il do not persist in post-embryonic _ tetrapods,"
"but arch II at least is present in sharks, some bony fish and lungfish. Arch"
II usually serves (with parts of the dorsal aortae) as the tetrapod carotid

"arteries, but in fish is usually interrupted by gills; arch [V is separated"
from the anterior arches in most tetrapods and becomes the systemic

"arch (see a Qe ta, vd OR Sa x); arch V is absent from adult tetrapods other"
"_ than urodeles, but serves as the D U C TUS ARTERI OSUS in develop-"
ment prior to lung function; arch VI then shifts to supply the lungs.

 
35 APICAL MERISTEM

 

Ape. General term for uommnor p primates of families Hylobatidae
"(gibbons, siamangs} and Pongidae (‘great, apes’). See a nt ez Ro POTD"

APHANIPTERA. S€@  SIPHONAPTERA (fleasj.

Apuip. Green fly.or black fly. Homopteran insect (Superfamily A phi-

PARTHENOGENESIS.

Apuyiious. Leafless.

ApicaL vominance. (Bot.) Influence exerted by a terminal bud in
suppressing growth of lateral buds. See a UXINS.

ApicAL MERISTEM. Growing point (zone of cell division) at tip of root
"and stem in vascular plants, having its origin in asingle cell (initial),"
"e.g. Pterophyta, or in a group of cells (initials), e.g. Anthophyta: In"
"the latter, the growing point apex (promeristem) consists of actively"
"dividing cells. Behind this, division continues and differentiation"
"begins, becoming progressively greater towards mature tissues. One"
(older) concept of growing point organization in flowering plants
"recognizes differentiation into three regions (histogens): dermatogen,"
"a superficial cell layer giving rise to the epidermis, plerome, a central"

core of tissue giving rise to the vascular cylinder and pith; and -

"periblem, tissue lying between derrnatogen and plerome, that gives"
tise to cortex. It is now evident that respective roles assigned to these
histogens are by no means universal; nor can periblem and plerome
"always be distinguished, especially in the shoot apex. Becoming"
"widely accepted is the funica-corpus concept, an interpretation of the"
"shoot apex recognizing two tissue zones in the promeristem: tunica,"
"consisting of one or more peripheral layers, in which the planes of"
"cell division are predominantly anticlinal, enclosing the corpus or"
central tissue of irregularly arranged cells in which the planes of cell
division vary. No relation is implied between cells of these two
regions and differentiated tissue behind the apex as in the histogen
"concept. Although epidermis arises ftom the outermost tunica layer,"
"underlying tissue may originate in tunica or in corpus, or in both, in"
different plant — species.

"Besides providing for growth in length of main axis, apical meristem"
"of stem is the site of origin of leaf and bud primordia. In roots, two types"
"of apical meristem occur, one in which vascular cylinder, cortex and"
"toot cap can be traced to distinct layers of cells in the promeristem, and"
a second type in which all tissues have a common origin in one group of
"promeristem cells. In contrast to those of stems, apical meristems of"
"roots provide only for growth in length, lateral roots originating some"
"distance from apex and, endogenously, from _ pericycle."

"Arms RACE, Lerm sometimes used to express the dialectical changes"
"in selection pressure that occur when regular, often unavoidable,"
conflicts of interest between two or more ‘ways of life’ favour an
adaptation for one party which creates a fresh ‘challenge’ for the
other to respond by adapting to. Such conflicts are common: pre-
"dator/prey; parasite/host,; parent/offspring and ‘male/female. It has"
been argued that selection will be the stronger where one party has
more to lose by ‘not evolving’ and minimizing the probability of
losing the conflict. Consequence to a prey organism of losing a
predator/prey conflict ig probably more serious than to a predator on
any occasion. Much depends on how likely such conflict encounters
are as to whether selection will favour whatever “costs’ may be
involved in evolving a ploy to avoid or win the conflict. Conflicts are
"best generalized as conflicts of ‘ways of life’, or strategies, rather-than"
"as conflicts between individuals, per se. Some conflicts of interest"

RNA CAPPING 500

 

and in others (retroviruses) it is reverse-transcribed into DNA.
tRNA molecules fold back upon themselves by complementary
base-pairing to form double-stranded ‘stems’ and single-stranded
‘loops’. A loop at one end bears a specific nucleotide triplet (the
anticodon) while the 3'-end of the molecule carries at RNA-specitfic
amino acid — both essential for protein synthesis to proceed by means
of a GENETIC cove. Ribosomal RNA subunits associate with
protein molecules to form rreosoms. All tRNA and rRNA
"molecule types are encoded by DNA (see cane), and there are many"
more of these molecules per cell than there are of mR NA. Some
"RNA molecules have catalytic activity (see Rwa processine,"

mkthylguanosine triphosphate to their 5’-end: Ribosomes recognize
this cap and commence translation at the A U G codon nearest to the

Asexua.. Of reproduction (or organisms) lacking all the following:
"meiosis, gamete production, fertilization (leading to genome or"
"nuclear union), transfer of genetic material between individuals, and"
"PARTHENOGENESIS. Includes, or issynonymous with, veczrarive"
reer Qo uc: On. Often employed (with parthenogenesis) as a means
of rapidly increasing progeny output during a favourable period
"(these having practically uniform genotype), hence common in inter-"
nal parasites (see potyvemeryvony). The basis of natural cloning
(artificially imposed in the propagation of plants by cuttings). May
alternate with sexual phase in tire cyCLte (see ALTERNATION oF
"seneRat1 Ons} Some organisms (e.g. Amoeba, trypanosomes) are"
"obligately asexual, and this raises questions about the evolutionary"
and ecological significance of sex.

A-site. (Of ribosome) binding site on ribosome for charged
"(amino-acyl, hence A for acyl) t RNA molecule in proven syn-"
THEsIs. See p-sITE.

Assimitation. Absorption of simple substances by an organism (i.e.
across cell membranes) and their conversion into more complicated
molecules which then become its constituents.

Association. (Of plants) climax plant community dominated by
particular species and named according to them; e.g. oak-beech
association of deciduous forest. Sometimes applied to very small
natural units of vegetation. See CONSO CIA TION.

"ASSORTATIVE matina (A. BREEDING). Non-random mating, involving"
"selection of breeding partner, usually based on some aspect of its"
phenotype. This ‘choice’ (consciousness not implied) may be per-
"formed by either sex, and may be positively assortative (choice like"
"self in some respect) or negatively assortative (disassortative, choice"
unlike self in some respect). Likely to have consequences for degree
of inbreeding and maintenance of potymorpursm. Some 1IN—
comparisinity mechanisms in plants are analogies. See srxvan
"SELECTION. ,"

Aster. A system of cytoplasmic striations radiating from the centriole
and consisting of mr cror UBULES; often conspicuous during clea-
"vage of egg, or during fusion of nucle! at fertilization. Also probably"
present in many other animal cells during division. Absent from
higher plants.

Asteroivea. Class of scutwopermara. Starfishes. Star-shaped;
"arms, containing projections of gut, not sharply marked off from"
"central part of body, mouth downwards; suckered wee reer; spines"
and pedicillariae. Carnivorous (some notoriously on oysters or

corals).

Astrocyte. One type of cxzan cent of central nervous system.
"Star-shaped, with numerous processes, they provide mechanical sup-"
port for transmitting cells by twining round them and attaching them
to their blood vessels. Different types are found in white and grey
matter of the CNS.

ATHEROSCLEROSIS. See SCLEROSIS .

"AtLas. First VERTEBRA, modified for articulation with. skull."
"Modified further in amniotes, which have freer head movement, than"
"in amphibians. Consists of simple bony ring, while a peg (odontoid"
"process) of the,next vertebra (the axzs) projects forward into the ring"
(through which the spinal cord also runs). This peg represents part of
the atlas (its centrum) which has become detached and fused to the
"axis. Nodding the-head takes place at the skull-atlas joint, rotation of"
head at atlas-axis joint.

ATP. Adenosine triphosphate. Adenyl nucleotide diphosphate. The
"common ‘energy currency of all cells, whose hydrolysis accompanies"
"and powers most cellular activity, be it mechanical, osmotic or"
chemical. Its two terminal phosphate groups have a more negative
Standard FR g& ££ NW erG x Of hydrolysis than phosphate compounds
"below it on the thermodynamic scale (e.g. sugar phosphates), and less"
"negative than those higher (eg. phosphocreatine, phosphoenolpyruv-"
"ate), -but this varies with intracellular concentrations of ATP, ADP"
and free phosphate aS well as pH. A utcH—-ENERGY PHOSPHATE
"(see -Fig. 33), it tends to lose its terminal phosphate to substances"

"lower on the scale, provided an appropriate enzyme is present, and"
its ‘mid-position on the scale enables it to serve as a common
intermediate in the bulk of enzyme-mediated phosphate-group trans-
fers in cells. Its relationship with AD P and A M P may be summarized:

"ATP + H,0 = AMP + PP; (pyrophosphate) — 10 keal mol-!"
ATP + AMP-ADP + ADP
"A TP =AD P +P, (inorganic phosphate) - 7.3 kcal mol""!"

The energy values are STANDARD FR.EEENERe y changes
"at pH 7, standard temperature and pressure, at 25°C."

Cells normally contain about ten times as much A T P as AD P and
"AMP, but when metabolically active the drop in the ATP/(A DP+"
AM P) ratio results in acceleration of exy cony 81 § and aerobic
"respiration (see resprrarton), the signal being detected by aLLo-"
sTz RIc enzymes in these pathways whose modulators (see enzyme)
"are AT P, AD P or AM P. AT P is not a reservoir of chemical energy"
in the cell but rather a transmitter or carrier of it. The bulk of ATP
"in eukaryotic cells is provided by mitochondria, where these are"
present. Some extra-mitochondrial ATP is produced anaerobically
"in the cytosol, and chloroplasts produce it but do not export it. ATP"
hydrolysis is used to transfer energy when work is done in cells.

 
£

ATPase 44

 

ATPase activity is found in_MYOSIN fe.g. Muscle CONTRAC-
TION) and DYNEIN (e.g. ciliary/flagellar beating). Membrane ion
pumps (eg. sodium and calcium pumps) and macromolecular syn-
theses of all kinds involve ATPase activity. Ultimately the energy
source for ATP formation in the biosphere is solar energy trapped
by autotrophs in photosynthesis -— plus some lithotrophy. All hetero-
trophs depend upon respiratory oxidation of these organic com-
"pounds to power their own ATP synthesis. ATP is, like the other"
"common nucleoside triphosphates in cells (CTP, GTP, TT P, U TP),"
"a substrate in nucleic acid synthesis, and its hydrolysis provides the"
energy needed to build the resulting AMP monomer into the growing
polynucleotide chain. These other triphosphates may participate in
some other energy transfers; but ATP has by far the major role. See
"AMP, ADP, PHOSPHAGEN, BACTERIORHODOPSIN."

AT Pase. Enzyme bringing about either (i) orthophosphate (P;)
"cleavage of ATP yielding A DP and inorganic phosphate, or (11) ."
pyrophosphate (2P;) cleavage of AT P to yield A M P and pyrophos-
phate. The latter provides a greater decrease in free energy and is
involved where a ‘boost’ is needed for an enzyme reaction. ATPase
"activity is found in myosin and dynein molecules, chloroplast thyla-"
koids and inner mitochondrial’ membranes (as A TP synthetase). See
"MITOCHONDRION, CHLOROPLAST, | BACTERIORHODOPSIN."

"ArauM. (1) Chamber, closed except for a small pore, surrounding gill"
slits of Amphioxus and urochordates. (2) A type of heart chamber of
"vertebrate chordates synonymous with ‘auricle’, receives blood from"
major vein and passes it to ventricle. Walls not as muscular as those
"of ventricle. Fishes have single atrium, but tetrapods, breathing"
"mainly or entirely by lungs, have two: one (the left) receives oxygen-"
"ated blood from lungs, the other (the right) receives deoxygenated"
blood from the body. Much of the blood flow though the atria is
passive (see marr ¢ YCLE). Non-chordates may have an-atrial compo-
"nent of the heart, e.g. some polychaete worms and most molluscs, in"
which the term ‘auricle’ is sometimes preferred. (3) A space or cavity
"in some invertebrates (e.g. platyhelminths, some miolfuscs) known as"
"the genital atrium, which houses the penis and/or opening of the"
"vagina, and into which these may open."

"Atropuy. Diminution in size of a structure, or in the amount of"
"tissue of part of the body. Generally involves destruction of cells, and"
"may be under genetic and hormonal control, as is frequently the case"
in metamorphosis. May also result from starvation. Compare
HYPERTROPHY.

Atropine. atxaroip inhibiting action of acetylcholine and _para-

AUSTRALIAN REGION. ZOOGEOGRAPHICAL REGION consisting
"“mainly of Australia, New Guinea and the Celebes; demarcated from"
south-east Asia by WALLACE’S tine.

"AUSTRALOPITHECINE. Member of genus Australopithecus, now ex-"
tinct; of the primate family Hominidae (see uomrwin). It appears to
"have been a long extant genus (roughly from 4-1 Myr BP), with"
pethaps as many as five Afncan species. A afarensis (4.0-3.0 Myr BP)
appears to have been a conservative species near the common ancestry

"of later forms, A gethiopicus and A africanus were later contemporaries ,"

(2.1-3 Myr BP) and possibly sister species with A. afarensis as
common ancestor; A. rebustus and A. boisei were later still (approx.
1.2-2Myr B P) and shared several derived features (synapomorphies).
"A aethiopicus, A robustus and A boisei were all ‘robust’ australopith-"
"ecines, with heavy skulls and facial features; A. africanus had more"
‘gracile* features and was possibly.ancestral to xoxo. Cranial capacities
of typical australopithecines were from 400-600 em? (modern man
"averages 1400 cm4), and the animals had bipedal posture and gait."
More fossil material and analysis are needed for definitive assessment

AUTOCATALYST 46

 

Autocatatyst. Any molecule catalysing its own production. The
"more produced, the more catalyst there is for further production."
"Most likely, some such process was involved in the origin of pre-"
"biological systems which, once enclosed in a membrane, might be"
called ‘living’. The current process whereby nucleic acid codes for
"enzymes that decode and replicate it is, in a strong sense, aytocataly-"

to a region).

Autoctave. Widely-used equipment for heat-sterilization. Commonly
"air is either pumped out prior to introduction of steam, or simply"
replaced by steam as the apparatus is heated under pressure. Material
being sterilized is usually heated at 121°C and 138-172 kNm_ pressure
"for 12 minutes, which destroys vegetative “bacteria, all —bacterialspores"
and viruses; but these figures will vary with the size and nature of
material.

smooth muscles and glands. Neither anatomically nor physiologically

 

 

 
 

47 AUTOSTYLIC JAW SUSPENSION

 

autonomous fromé&e central nervous system. Sometimes termed the’
"‘involuntary’! nervous system, but here again its effects (in humans)"
can largely be- brought under conscious control with training. For
convenience the ans can be subdivided into two components: the
parasympathetic and sympathetic systems

Parasympathetic nerve fibres are CHOLINERGIC and in mammals
"are found as motor components of crantat weaves III, VII, IX"
"and X, as well as of three spinal nerves in sacral segments 24. Most"
of its effects are brought about by its distribution in the vagus (CN
"X), serving the gnt (see aversacu's prexus), liver and heart"
among ot her organs.

Fibres of the sympathetic system originate within the spinal cord
",of the.thoracic and lumbar segments, but beyond the vertebrae each"
. departs from the cord and tums ventrally in a short white ramus (rami
"communicantes) to enter a sympathetic ganglion, a chain of which"
"lies on either side of the mid-line, In the sympathetic ganglia many of"
the preganglionic fibres relay with postganglionic fibres that innervate
"target organs (e.g. mesenteries and gut), others pass straight through"
as splanchnic nerves and meet in plexi (collectively termed the .solar
plexus) beneath the lumbar vertebrae. “From here postganglionic
"fibres innervate much of the gut, liver, kidneys and adrenals. Post-"
"ganglionic fibres usually” liberate catecholamines, particularly ner-"
"adrenaline. Preganglionic parasympathetic, fibres are relatively long"
"and usually synapse in a ganglion on of near the effector, post-"
"ganglionic fibres being short., In general ANS preganglionic fibres"
"are myelinated, postganglionic unmyelinated and usually (there are"
"exceptions) where the sympathetic stimulates, the parasympathetic"
"inhibits, and vice versa; but organs are not always innervated by"
"both. Both are, however, under central control, notably via the"
hypothalamus. Together they afford homeostatic nervous control
"of the internal organs, often reflexly:"

"taken up by cells, tissues, etc., from an artificially enriched medium"
"and localized inside them, to expose a plate sensitive to the emissions,"

Autotomy. Self-amputation of part of the body. Some lizards can
"break off part of the tail when seized by a predator, muscular action"
snapping a vertebra. Both here and in many polychaete worms which
"can shed damaged parts of the body, rzcznzrarzon restores the"
autotomized part.

AUTOTROPHIC. Of those organisms independent of external sources of
organic carbon (compounds) for provision of their own organic
"constituents, which they can manufacture entirely’ from inorganic"
material. Autotrophs may be phototrophic or chemotrophic as re-
"gards energy supply, using solar or chemical energies respectively."
"Most chlorophyli-containing plants are autotrophic, manufacturing"
"organic material from water, carbon dioxide and mineral ions"
"(nitrates, phosphates, sulphates, metal ions, etc.) and using solar"
energy phototrophically (see PHOTOSYNTHESIS). Some bacteria and
the blue-green algae are also phototrophic; other bacteria are chemo-
"trophic, using energy released from inorganic oxidations (e.g. of"
"“hydrogen sulphide by sulphur bacteria, or of hydrogen by hydrogen"
bacteria). The term lithotroph is applied to those autotrophs which
employ inorganic’ oxidants to oxidize inorganic reductants (e.g. the
"nitrifying bacteria Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter, of the NITROGEN"
"CYCLE). All other organisms, HETEROTROPHIC in one form or"
"another, depend upon the synthetic activities of autotrophic organ-"
isms for their energy and nutrients. See ECOSYSTEM.

"Auxins. Group of plant crowra sussrances, produced by many"
regions of active cell division and enlargement (eg. growing tips of
"stems and young leaves), that regulate many aspects of plant growth."
"Promote growth by increasing rate of cell clongation, apparently by"
"activating a proton pump in the plasmalemma, pumping H+ out of"
"the cell, acidifying the cell “wall and loosening bonds within it, so"
promoting cell expansion through turgor. Auxins also affect cznz
"express I on, increasing production of cell wall material in the"
longer term (apparently independently of the proton pump). Trans-
"ported basipetally in shoots at a rate of about 1 cm/hour, they act"
"synergistically with G [BBER eum in stem cell elongation, and with"
CY TOKININ in control of buds behind the apical bud (apical domin-
"ance). Effects of auxins on cell growth include curvature responses,"
such as cgorroprsm and puororroprsm. AUXINS may also have
"mitogenic effects, as in initiation of cambial activity in association"
"with cytokinins, and in adventitious root formation in cuttings. They"
"are also implicated in flower initiation, sex determination, fruit"
"growth, and delays in leaf fall and fruit drop."

 
49 AXIL

 

Naturally-occuring auxins include indole-3-acetic acid (1 A A) and
indole-3-acetonitrile (IAN). IAA has been isolated from such diverse
"sources as corn endosperm, fungi, bacteria, human saliva and, the"
"richest natural source, human urine. In addition to naturally occur-"
"ring auxins, many substances with plant growth regulatory activity"
(synthetic auxins) have been produced. Some are used on a very large
scale for regulating growth of agriculturally and horticulturally im-
"portant plants, as in inhibition of sprouting in potato tubers, preven-"
"tion of fruit drop in orchards, achievement of synchronous _ flowering"
(and hence fruiting) in pineapple; also parthenocarpic fruit produc-
"tion, as in tomato, avoiding risks of poor pollination. At increased,"
"though still relatively low, concentration, auxins inhibit growth,"
sometimes resulting in death. Some synthetic auxins have differential
"toxicity in different plants:. toxicity of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic"
"acid (2,4-D) to dicotyledonous and non-toxicity to monocotyledon-"
"ous: plants is perhaps best known, being exploited successfully in"
control of w =z ps in cereal crops and lawns.

"BacteriA. Unicellular, filamentous and mycelial  proxarvorss,"
of the Kingdom Monera. Among the simplest of all known organisms
(see cE for diagram). Opinions differ on whether to include the
blue-green algae within bacteria (see cyanopacrerta). Work
on ARCHAEBACTERIA suggests that these form a distinctive
"side-branch. The description which follows relates to ‘true’ bacteria,"
"Of gusactertates, Which vary greatly in shape, being rod-like"
"(bacilli), spherical (cocci), more or less spiral (spirilli), filamentous"

BACTERIOPHAGE (PHAGE). A virus parasitizing bacteria. The
genetic material is always housed in the centre of the phage particle
and may be DNA or RN A = the former either double- or single-
"stranded, the latter double-stranded. RN A phages are very simple;"
"the more complex T-even DNA phages have a head region, collar,"
tail and tail fibres; some (e.g. @X174) are entirely spherical; others
(e.g. M13) are filamentous. Some (e.g. PM2) contain a lipid bilayer
between an outer and inner protein shell. The complex phage 14 has
a polyhedral head about 70 nm across containing double-stranded
"DNA, enclosed by a coat (capsid) of protein subunits (capsomeres);"
a short collar or ‘neck’ region; a cylindrical tail (or tailsheath) region
and six tail fibres. The particle (viron) of T4 phage is quite large -
about- 300 nm in length. It initiates infection by attachment of tail
fibres to the bacterial cell wall at specific receptor sites. This is
followed by localized lysis of the wall by previously inert viral
"enzymes in the tail and by contraction of the viral tail sheath, forcing"
the hollow tail core through the host cell wall to inject the phage
"DNA. Virulent phuges (such as T4, T7, ¢X174) engage ina subse- _"
quentytie—cyele. inside the -hest-cell: Their- cireular genomes -are-
"transcribed and translated, causing arrest of host macromolecule"
synthesis and production of virion DNA and coat proteins. Lysis of
"the cell releases the virions. Filamentous phages (e.g. M13, fl, fd) do"
"not lyse the host cell, but even permit it to multiply. Eventually they"
get extruded through the cell wall. Some temperatephages (eg. }) can
insert their genome into their host’s and be replicated with it; others
(c.g. Pl) replicate within a bacterial plasmid. This non-lethal infective
"relationship does not involve transcription of phage genome, and is"
"termed lysogeny, the phage being termedprophuge. Lysogenic bacteria"

may be enhanced by UV light and other mutagens. A replication
cycle from adsorption to release of new phage takes ~ 15-20 mins.

Transduction occurs when temperate phage ftom one lysogenic culture
"infects a second bacterial culture, taking with it a small amount of"
closely-linked DNA which remains as a stable feature of the recipient
cell. Antibiotic resistance can be transferred this way (see an 1 -

BACTERIORHODOPSIN. Conjugated protein of the ‘purple membrane’
"of the photosynthetic bacterium Halobacterium halobium, forming a"
proton channel whose prosthetic group (retinal) is light-absorbing
and identical to that of vertebrate rod cells. Allosteric change on
"illumination of the pigment‘ results in proton ejection from the cell,"
the resulting proton gradient being used to power ATP synthesis. Its
integration into urosomes along with mitochondrial AT P syn-
"thetase showed that the latter is also a proton channel, driven by a"
proton gradient. If chlorophyll-based photosynthesis evolved after a
thodopsin-based variety then absence of green-absorption in chloro-
"phyll’s action, spectrum may be due to selection in favour of a"
pigment avoiding competition with abundant thodopsin- based forms.

"B-cELL (B tvmeHocyte). A LeucocYTE, derived from a tymerozp"
tissue stem cell which has migrated from foetal liver to bone
marrow and has not entered the thymus but has settled either in a
lymph node or in the spleen. B-cells express a specific immuno-
"globulin (Ig, or awrrsovy) on their plasma membranes. This can"
"bind appropriate antigen, when the cell becomes activated to divide"
repeatedly by mitosis and produce a clone’ of specific antibody-coated
cells. This primary immune response (see YMMUN 1 ty) Is also char-
"acterized by their secretion of specific IgM antibody into the blood,"

‘the combined effect being to remove antigen. Some B-cells do not
"greatly participate in Ig production, but circulate in the body and"
"may persist for years as memory cells, capable of clonal expansion"
and rapid Ig secretion (a secondary immune response) if activated by
the initial antigen. This provides immunological memory. Still other
B-cells mature into plasma cells (the major Ig-producer in a secondary
"response) after multiplication, and although these progeny cells may"
"have Igs of more than one class, they all have the same antigen ."

Bicow cene. (bcd). A pattern-specifying marzrnan cznz in
"Drosophila, whose mRNA transcript passes From maternal ovary"
nurse cells to anterior poles of developing oocytes where it becomes
"localized, apparently trapped by the oocyte cytoskeleton. Its eventual"
protein product is a transcription activator (with a DNA-binding
"homoeodomain), is located in nuclei of the syncytial blastoderm, and"
is translocated half-way along the embryo from the anterior pole.
With a similar translocation of OSKAR cexe product in the opposite
"direction, two opposing gradients of: maternally encoded proteins"
provide quantitative rosrrronan rrormarron Which the embryo
genome converts into qualitative phenotypic differences. Genes
"involved in this conversion process, ic. Kruppel (Kr), hunchback (hb)"
"and knirps (kni), belong to the qe ene class, and all three encode"
proteins with DNA-binding rincer DOMAINS. Bicoid product is
"responsible for production of a normal head and thorax, structures"

and the oskar product are examples of MORPHOGENS.

By epressing transcription of Kr in anterior and posterior embryo

"mid-embryo. High levels of dcdprodyst activate hb transcription, while"
"low levels permit Kr transcription. However, their abilities to elicit"
such zygotic (embryo) gene expression depend upon the affinities of
"their respective DNA-binding sites for them, and these are known to"
vary. The hb and Kr products are mutual repressors of each others’
"transcription, so that their ‘domains’ of prod&t expression become"
stable and restricted. These gap gene domains delimit the domains of

BinomiaL Nomenctature. The existing method of naming organisms
scientifically and the lasting contribution to taxonomy of tm ag s.
Each newly described organism (usually in a paper published in a

 

 
BIOASSAY 60

 

"recognized scientific journal) is.placed in a genus, which gives it the,"
first of its two (italicized)- latin names its generic name — and is
always given a capital first letter. Thus the genus- Canis would
probably be given to any new placental wolf discovered. Within this
genus there- may or may not be other species already described; in
"any case, the new species will receive a second (specific) name’ to"
"follow its generic name, this time with a lower case first letter. The"
"wolf found in parts of Europe, Asia and. North America belongs to"
"the species Canis hepus; jackals, coyotes-and true dogs (including the"
"domesticated dog) also belong to- the genus Caris, but cach species is"
"further identified by a different specific name: the domestic dog, in all"
"its varieties, is C. familiaris (often only the first letter of the genus ts"
"given, if it is contextually clear what the genus is). If a previously"
"described species is subsequently moved into another genus, it takes"
"the new generic name, but carries the old specific name. The author"
who ‘published the original description of a species often. receives
credit in “the form of an abbreviation of their name after the initial
mention of the species in a paper or article. Thus one might see Canis
"lupus Linn.,since Lirinaeus first described this species. The specimen"
upon which the initial published description was based is termed the
"‘type specimen, or ‘type’, and is probably housed in a museum for"
comparison with other specimens. If sufficient variation exists within
"a species range for sus srz C rzs or Varieties to be recognized, then a"
trinomial is’ employed to identify the subspecies or variety. The
British wren rejoices under the: trinomial Troglodytes troglodytes

Bioassay. Quantitative estimation of biologically active substances
"by measurement of their. activity in standardized, conditions on living"
"organisms or their parts. A ‘standard curve’ is first produced, relating"

generally accepted that every individual organism has a genetic
ancestry involving prior organisms. The first appearance of living

Biocenetic Law. Notorious view propounded by Ernst Haeckel in
about 1860 (a more explicit formulation of his mentor Muller's view)
that during an animal’s development it passes through ancestral
adult stages (‘ontogenesis is a brief and rapid recapitulation of
phylogenesis’). Much of the evidence for this derived ftom the work

"wastes, hormones, gases and osmotically active compounds} in which"
are suspended cells (haemocytes} functioning cither in defence (cg.
phagocytes) or oxygen transport (€.g. rep stoop cELLS). Blood is
moved by muscle contraction in some of the vessels it passes through.
"Hearts are such specialized vessels, the hydrostatic pressure generated"
"being employed in filtration processes (in capillaries generally, and"
"kidney glomeruli in particular), in locomotion (e.g. many bivalve"
molluscs} and other activities besides solute translocation. Arthropod
"blood (haemolymph) is hardly confined to vessels (open circulation),"
"insects and onychophorans having least vascularization, the haemo-"
"coele being much expanded. When blood is confined to vessels, the"
"circulation is said to be closed, as it is throughout annelid and"

lower vertebrates. Respiratory pigment (absent in most insects) is in
"simple solution in invertebrate blood, but confined to red blood cells"
(erythrocytes) in vertebrates. See rrssue  rturD.

BLoop cLoTTinc (B. coacutation). Adaptive response to haemor-
"thage involving local conversion of liquid blood to a gel, which plugs"
"a wound. In vertebrates, blood does not clot in normal passage"
through vessels since the smooth endothelial lining prevents damage
to platelets. The altered surface of damaged vessel walls plus turbu-
"lence of blood flow results in ADP release from platelets, and the"
"exposed collagen in vessel walls causes adherence of platelets, which"
"release Ca++ and cause more aggregation. Vasoconstriction, stem-"
"ming blood flow, results from se ROTON 1m _ released when platelets"
fragment. A temporary plug of platelets is made permanent by a
C asc a ve of enzymic reactions caused by release of phospholipid
and the protein thromboplastin (thrombokinase) by damaged cells
and platelets. Ten clotting factors in addition to.the above have been
isolated; but the main sequence may be summarized as: thrombo-
"plastin (Factor III) converts prothrombin (Factor II) to thrombin,"
"which converts fibrinogen (Factor I) to an imsoluble fibrin meshwork,"
"trapping erythrocytes, platelets and plasma to form clot, stabilized by"
Factor XIII in presence of Ca++ (Factor IV). Fibrin absorbs 90% of
the thrombin formed and prevents the clot from spreading away
from the damaged area. Several genetic disorders cause poor clotting.
"Factor VII, one of the substances required for thromboplastin forma-"
"tion, is absent in classical X-linked haemophilia. See a x tr co a ou «"
"LANT, FIBRINOLYSIS."

Boop croup. Either a group of people bearing the same antigen(s)

on their red blood cells within a particular BLOOD croup system;
or the blood characteristic used to distinguish groups of individuals
within a blood group system. Main clinical significance lies in blood
transfusion and Rhesus incompatibility between mother and foetus.
"Without due matching of donor and recipient blood, death or severe"
illness of a recipient may ‘result from a single transfusion (in A B 0
system) or after repeated tranfusion (in Rhesus system). Causes of
"death include haemolysis (red cell rupture), agglutination (red cell"
"clumping) with blockage of capillaries etc., and tissue damage."
Danger in transfusion comes when donor antigens meet antibodies to
them in recipient plasma and elsewhere resulting in Inn are ruwone
x Es PONSE. Antibodies to antigens of the A B 0 system occur natural-
ly in plasma; those to Rhesus antigens occur in plasma only as a
"result of immunization, during pregnancy or transfusion. People with"
an antigen of the ABO system on their red cells automatically lack
"the antibody to it in their plasma, whereas lack of an ABO antigen"
on the red cells is coupled to presence of antibody to it in plasma

BLOOD GROUP SYSTEM 68

 

BLoop croup System. A person’s blood groups are genetically
"determined, each person belongs to several, and most are determined"
by loci situated on autosomes. The alleles at these loci determine
antigens on a person’s red blood cell membranes. A blood “group
system refers to the range of red cell antigens “determined by the
"alleles at one such locus, or sometimes a group of closely linked loci."
Some non-human primates share certain human blood group
"systems. In humans there are at least 14 such systems (ABO, Rhesus,"
"MNS, P, Kell, Lewis, Lutheran, Duffy, Kidd, Diego, Yt, I, Dom-"
brock and Xg). Only the Xg locus is  sex-linked. No linkage between

The two basic types of cell architecture are those of PROKARYOTES
"and BUKARYOTES. See Fig. 3. In the former, cells consist entirely of"
"cytoplasm (lacking nuclei); in the latter, cells have (or had) in addition"
"one or more nuclei. Eukaryotic cells have greater variety of organelles,"
many enclosed in one or more membranes (see c zLL mempranes) .
"They are.further distinguished by the presence of distinctive proteins,"
", particularly ACTIN, MYOSIN, TUBULIN and HISTONE, that have"
very .signifieant uses and are entirely absent from prokaryotic cells. ~
Actin is paramount in the structure of the eukaryotic cyTo-

and in mitotic and meiotic spindles ~ none- of these being found-in
"prokaryotes, whose flagella are, rigid and of a completely different"

Fission occurs as membrane intuckings fuse. No microtubules occur in
"prokaryotes, so there is no mitosis or meiosis; (b) eukaryotic: nuclear"
and cytoplasmic divisions are achieved by separate mechanisms. In
higher eukaryotes the nuclear membrane breaks down and chromo-
somes attach to microtubules of the spindle by their KINETOCHORES;
cytoplasmic division (eytokimesis) usually starts in mitotic anaphase
and proceeds by a furowing of the plasmalemma in the plane of the
"metaphase plate, achieved by a contractile ring of ACTIN _ filaments."
Fusion of the invaginating plasmalemma then occurs. In plant cells

CELL Fractionation. Process whereby cells are first appropriately
buffered (often in sucrose solution) and then disrupted (by osmotic
"shock, sonic vibration, maceration or grinding with fine glass, sand,"
etc.); the cell fragments are then spun in a refrigerated centrifuge.
Different cell components descend to the bottom of the centrifuge

Cett Fusion. Process involving fusion of plasma membranes of two
cells to form one resultant cell. Naturally occurring cell fusion may
or may not result in hybridization (unity of genomes). Fusion of
"my oszasts in skeletal muscle development, and other syncytial"

of prasmocamy and xaryocamy are temporally.separated in

organism; in most cases starts with the zygote from which all an
organism’s cells are derived by cell division but often implies a more
or less restricted cz one of cells forming a functional subset of the
whole cell population. See wersma nn.

"CELL Locomotion. There are various methods by which cells imove,"
those of prokaryotes having apparently little in common with those
"of eukaryotes. For the latter, most mechanisms seem to involve"
protein tubules or filaments sliding past one another and generating
force. The details of how force is transmitted to the substratum
remain largely unknown.

(1) Bacterial: H+ gradients across the inner cell membrane provide
"the. motive force for rotation of the riacexuum, whose fixed helix"
of protein subunits permits clockwise and counter-clockwise rota-
"tions, like a corkscrew. This involves an extraordinary ‘wheel-like’"
"rotor in the inner membrane, and cylindrical fixed bearing in the"
outer membrane. Reversal of flagellar rotation alters the behavibur
of the cell.

"(2) Eukaryo tic. (a) Ciliary/flagellar: ee c 1 1 1 UM for structure, Paired"
outer microtubules slide over adjacent pairs in response to forces
generated by dynein arms coupled to their ATPase activity. Radial
spokes and the inner sheath apparently convert this sliding to bending .
of the organelle. The axoneme can beat without the cell membrane
sheath around it. The dynein arms probably act in an equivalent
fashion to myosin heads during musctz cowrracrron and make
contact with adjacent microtubule pairs during their power stroke.
Control of ciliary/flagellar beat appears to be independent of Ca++
"flux, but may be dependent upon signal relay via proteins, of the"
"actual structure. However, reversal of ciliary beat in some ciliates is"
associated with membrane voltage change brought about by Ca++
influx. It is still uncertain how waves of ciliary beating in cell surfaces
are coordinated. (6) ‘Fibroblastic’ crawling: the leading edge of a cell
"engaged in this method of locomotion, characteristic of fibroblasts,"
"extends forwards and, after attachment to the substratum, pulls the"
rest of the cell forward by contraction of actin microfilaments under
influence of myosin. Typical features associated with this method are
"lamellipodia and microspikes (see cett memeranes), Which both"
"pass backwards in waves along the upper cell surface (‘ruffling’),"
typically when the anterior of the cell has failed to attach to the
"substratum. Molecular mechanisms involved are not clear, but it"
seems that random endocytosis of plasmalemma and its subsequent
restricted exocytosis (incorporating the membrane pieces) at the

 
 

91 CELL MEMBRANES

 

anterior of the cell generates a circulation of membrane akin to
movement of tank caterpillar tracks. The protein FrBRo NECT iw is
involved in fibroblast crawling. (c) ‘Amoeboid’ (pseudopodial): the
cells outermost layer is gel-like (plasmagel) while the core is a fluid
sol (plasmasol). It is possible that contraction of the thick cortical
plasmagel squeezes the plasmasol and generates pseudopodial ex-
"tensions of the cell, at the tips of which sol-to-gel transformation"
"occurs. Gel-to-sol changes accompany this elsewhere in the cell, eg."
as a pseudopod retracts. Just how these cyroptasmzc stRean—
"inc events are coupled to locomotion is not clear, but motive force"
must act against regions where the cell adheres to its substratum (see
"FiseQwe crazy. Apparently, surfaces of large amocbac are relatively"
"permanent, undergoing folding and unfolding to accommodate pseudo-"
pod extension and retraction. ACTI » is implicated in the process.

Cet membranes. Cells may have a wide variety of membranes
(often called ‘unit’ membranes) varying from 5-10 nm in thickness;
"but all have a plasma membrane (plasmalemma), the outer limit of"
"the cell proper, which is generally quite distinct from any cell wall"
material present (which is — extracellular).

Major membrane functions include: restriction and control of move-
ments of molecules (e.g. holding the cell together) enabling scarce
metabolites to reach local concentrations sufficient to enhance
enzyme-substrate interactions; to act as platforms for the spatial
"organization of enzymes and their cofactors, holding otherwise _ scat-"
tered molecules in functional contact; and separation and _ localization
of incompatible reactions. Many eukaryotic organelles have one or
"two membranes around them, chloroplasts having yet a third system"
within. The currently accepted structure of most cell membranes is
"that proposed in the fluid mosaic model, the evidence coming from X."

adding peaks or troughs to the lipid spectrum.

In this model an outer and an inner phospholipid monolayer (major

polar phosphate heads in the direction of the water which the bilayer
"thus separates. Specific, and different, proteins lie in one or other"
"layer or traverse the bilayer, making the membrane asymmetric"

comprise about 40-50% lipid and 50-60% protein by weight. The
"phospholipid bilayer has a non-polar hydrophobic interior, prevent-"
ing passage of most polar and all charged molecules. Small non-polar
molecules readily dissolve in it and uncharged polar molecules (e.g.

"H,0) can also diffuse rapidly across it, possibly assisted by the polar"
phospholipid heads; or by such ‘ionospheres as gramicidin. Lipid
bilayers are impermeable to carbohydrates and ions’ at the diffusion
rates needed by cells; but membranes contain various tr an sport

the specificity of proteins exposed at a membrane surface.

"Not all membrane phospholipids are identical, and this prevents their"

Each chiasma may involve either of the two chromatids of each
chromosome. Appreciation that chiasmata result from breakage and
reciprocal refusion between chromatids during the first meiotic pro-
phase was a major achievement of classical cytogenetics and is due
largely to Jannsens and Darlington (their chiasmatype theory). The
molecular mechanism involved may incorporate enzymes that. were
formerly part of a DNA REPAIR MECHANISM. Several chiasmata

CHROMOCENTRE. Region of constitutive HETEROCHROMATIN which
aggregates in interphase nucleus. In Drosophila all four chromosome
pairs become fused at their centromere regions in eo ty mn ze nuclei
to form a large chromocentre.

CHromomeres. Darkly staining (heterochromatic) bands visible at
intervals along chromosomes in a pattern characteristic for each
"chromosome. Especially visible in mitotic and meiotic prophases, and"
at bases of loops of LAMPBRUSH CHROMOSOMES. Probably reflects
tight clustering of groups of chromosome loops (see CHROMOSOME).
Dark bands of polytene chromosomes are probably due to multiple
parallel chromomeres.

CHromonema. Term usually used for chromosome thread while
extended and dispersed throughout nucleus during __ interphase.

CHROMOPLAST (CHROMATOPHORE). Pigmented plant cell PLASTID.
"May be red, orange or yellow, e.g. tomato fruits, carrot roots"
"(containing carotenoid pigments), or green (chloroplasts), —_ containing"
chlorophyll. Former are common in fruits and flowers and develop
from leucoplasts or chloroplasts. See cHLoropiast.

"Curomosome. Literally, a coloured (i.e. stainable) body; originally"
observed as threads within eukaryote nuclei during mitosis and
"meiosis. Composed of nucleic acid, most commonly DNA, usually in"
"conjunction with various attendant proteins, in which form the"
genetic material of all cells is organized. Chromosomes are linear  se-
"quences of cenes, plus additional non-genetic (i.e. apparently non-"
functional) nucleic acid sequences. Gene sequence is probably never
"random, being the result of selection for particular LINKAGE groups"
(but see rransposaste stemenr). Prokaryotes and eukaryotes
"differ in the amount of genetic material which needs to be packaged,"
and in resulting complexities of their chromosomes. Thus the absence
"to date from prokaryotic chromosomes of the DNA-binding proteins,"
"histones, has some taxonomic value (see ce rom AT? wn). Non-histone"
proteins (e.g. protamines) form part of the structure of all chromo-
"somes, however, and their roles, for example as activators of tran-"
"scription, are being increasingly elucidated. The DNA of a normal"
individual chromosome or chromatid is probably just one highly
folded molecule.

The prokaryotic chromosome (usually one main chromosome per
"cell) is just over 1 mm in length, contains about 4 x 10% base pairs of"
"DNA, is circular and is attached to the cell membrane, at least during"
DNA replication. It lacks the nucleosome infrastructure of eukaryotic
"chromatin. Additionally, there may be one or more » 1 ASM 1s, some"
of which (megaplasmids) may constitute more than 2% of the cell’s
"DNA. There is no nucleus to contain the chromosome, but the term"
‘nucleoid’ may be used to indicate this region of the cell. The D N A
appears to be packaged in a series of loops (see later). Eukaryotic

"chromosomes ate made of chromatin, containing DNA and five"
different histone species roughly equal in total weight to the DNA;
plus various attendant proteins. The fundamental organizational unit
"is the NU c LEOSOME, a polynucleosome giving rise in turn during"
nuclease digestion to mononucleosomes (200 DNA base pairs) chro-
matosomes (165 DNA base pairs) and nucleosome core particles
(145 DNA base pairs). See Fig. 8.

"The polynucleosome filament has a diameter of about 10 nm, but"
adopts a tight 30 nm helix under physiological ion concentrations.
This reduces the DNA length 50-fold and may be the normal inter-
phase state of chromatin. Further looping along a single axis forms a
fibre 0.3 pm in width which may in turn form a helix of radially
"arranged loops about 0.7 ym in diameter, possibly the metaphase"
chromatin condition. Bands seen in stained mitotic chromosomes
"probably reflect tight clustering of groups of loops, which stain more"
densely. Polytene chromosome bands (see POL Y TEN Y) would result
from lateral amplification of these tightly clustered loops. The higher
orders of chromatin packing are features of HETEROCHROMATIN
"such as chromocentres, centromeres, and pericentric regions. The"
"virus genome may be of either DNA or RNA, in single-stranded or"
"double-stranded form, the protem-coat of the virus often being  instru-"
mental in chromosome — packing.

but only their probability of RECOMBINATION.

CHROMOSOME wmaprine. Several techniques involved in constructing a
model (or map) of the linear gene. sequence of a chromosome (or
chromosome pair). Traditionally this amounts to a map of the
"sequence of loci along a chromosome patr, but the rise of molecular"
"genetics, particularly the use of microorganisms, has provided, details"
"of chromosome base sequences, and a shift from the locus to the"
CISTRON or OPERON as the functional unit of chromosome struc-
"ture. For most. eukaryotes, L INK AGE between two or more loci is"
normally detected by first obtaining a generation (normally an F1)
heterozygous for the two loci concemed (1c. doubly heterozygous).
"This is normally achieved by first crossing two stocks, each pure-"
breeding for ene of the two mutant phenotypes involved. The F1
stock is then crossed to a doubly wild-type stock and the resulting
offspring scored for phenotypes. If all four possible phenotypes
(assuming complete dominance of wild-type over the mutant pheno-
"type) are present in equal ratio, linkage is not probable; but if"
there is a departure in the ratios from those expected. on the null
"hypothesis of no linkage, then this departure can be tested for"
its significance (using CHI-SQUARED TEST). Where the ratio is
 

CHROMOSOME MAPPING 112

 

"obviously non-Mendelian (ic. departs obviously from 1: 1: 1: 1), with"
"the parental classes outnumbering the recombinants, then a cCRoss-"
Oo V er vA tc UE can be determined giving a map distance between the
two loci.

When we wish to know whether the loci bearing the alleles for black
body and vestigial wing (both recessive characters) in Drosophila are
"linked, then using the symbols"

b = black body

+ =wild-type body
v = vestigial wing
+ = wild-type wing

first pure-breeding black body/wild-type wing flies (b+ + ) are
mated with pure-breeding wild-type body/vestigial wing flies (+ +
vv). Fl offspring are then mated with a double recessive stock (i.e.
"pure-breeding black body/vestigial wing, bbvv) as a vest cross. If all"
"four resulting offspring phenotypes (+ +,+ v, 6+, 4v) occur in"
"equal ratio then, given adequate sample size, linkage is unlikely. If"
"two phenotypic classes (the parental classes, 6+ , + v) outnumber the"
"other two (the two recombinant classes, bv, + +) then linkage is"
"likely and a provisional map distance can be calculated, equal to the"
frequency of the recombinant offspring as a percentage of the total |
"number of offspring. (The example is actually more complex, for"
only when male flies are used as the double recessive in the backcross
do four phenotypic classes appear in the F2 generation. This is
because in male Drosophila there is no crossing-over during meiosis
(see suppressor mutation) so the males cited only produce two
"gamete types, giving only two F2 phenotypes.) Sex-linked loci would"
"give a different result, suitably modified to take account of the"

“chromosome arrangement of the heterogametic sex. When testing for
"linkage between mutations for dominant characters, the recessive"
characters in the method employed above would be wild-type
characters.

"Chromosome mapping in bacteria can employ transformation,"
"TRanSpuCTIon or interrupted mating. In the latter, progress of the"
donor bacterial chromosome into the recipient cell during conjugation
"is interrupted, as by shaking (see F racror, for Hfr strain). The"
map of cistrons on the incoming chromosome will be a function of

"the time allowed for conjugation before interruption, and is deduced"
from recipient cell phenotypes. The c 1 s / m a NS 1 & st may be used to
determine whether two mutations lie within the same cistron. In
"deletion mapping, gene sequences can be ascertained by noting"
whether or not wild-type recombinants occur in appropriate crosses
between mutant strains: they will not do so if the part of the
"chromosome needed for recombination is missing, so that fine map-"
ping of such recombinants can indicate the limits of a deletion and
the genes involved in it! Plasmid and viral chromosome maps may be

Cuassirication. Any method organizing and systematizing the

"Belief in the existence of a pre-arranged (divine?) natural order,"

"the early 19th century, but has dwindled since the publication of"
"Darwin’s The Origin of Species in 1859. However, there is still"
considerable dialogue between ESSENTIALIST and womrazisr
accounts of biological classification as to whether the groups which

 
 

 

 

119 ‘CLATHRIN

 

different classifications recognize are ‘natural’ (real) or merely human
constructs (artificial). Characters are not randomly distributed among
"organisms but tend to cluster together with high predictability, sug-"
gesting that all the taxonomist has to do is discover the various
"nested sets of characters to attain a ‘natural’ classification. However,"
even the category which seems to have most to recommend its
objective reality in “nature (the species) lacks some of the features of a
NATURAL KIND.

The charge of arbitrariness (artificiality) over the rules of  classifica-
tion has led to the. search for an objective methodology. -The solution
of numerical taxonomists has been to select not just one or a few
characters which are given added weight (offen apparently arbitrarily)
"in comparisons between organisms,.but to give all phenetic characters"
equal weight in the expectation that natural (as opposed to artificial)
groups will automatically emerge as clusters through overall phenetic
similarity. The taxonomist then arranges these clusters into a rule-
governed hierarchy of groups.

"But this approach also has arbitrary clements, although favoured _ by"
some mathematically minded taxonomists. Critics argue that it fails
to achieve a genealogically based classification: they deny that overall
"similarity alone is a sure guide to recency of common ancestry. Thus,"
crocodiles and lizards share more common features than either does
with birds; “yet crocodiles and birds share a more recent common
ancestor than either does with lizards. If there is anything like an
objectifying principle available to taxonomists it must surely be
genealogy. Two principal schools of taxonomy which endeavour to
objectify their methods by acknowledging the process of evolution in
this way are eladism and evolutionary taxonomy. The principal differ-
ence between them (see crap 1s rz cS) is that cladists include qj]
descendant species along with the ancestral species within. taxonomic
"groups, evolutionary taxonomists hold that different rates of adapta-"
tion within the descendant groups of a single ancestor should be
reflected in the classification. This may require that those that have
diverged more from the ancestral stock are given special (often
higher) taxonomic ranking compared with those that have diverged
"less, and that consequently nof aif descendant species will be included"
in the taxon of the ancestral species. Much depends on the accepted
definition of w oN OP Hx. 27 Ic. All biological classifications are hier-
"archical: the higher the taxonomic category, the more inclusive. In"
"descending order of inclusiveness, and omitting intermediate (sub-"
"and super-) taxa, the sequence is: kingdom, phylum (division in"
"botany), class, order, family, genus, species. There are however enor-"
"mous difficulties in establishing accurate genealogical __ classifications,"
not least with taxa which are extinct. See rpewrrFrCaTroNn xEvs.

CONJUGATION. 132

 

Conuuaation. (1) Union in which two individuals or filaments fuse
together to exchange or donate genetic material. The process can
involve a conjugation tube as in members of the Zygnematales (e.g.
"Spirogyra),. ot a copulation tube as seen in some Bacillariophyta, or"
no tube at-all. as in the Desmidiales. Process also occurs in fungi. In
bacterial conjugation only a portion of the genetic material is trans-
"ferred from the donor dell. Sex pili form (see’ prLus), followed> by"

"“transmission of one or more plasmids from one cell to the other, ‘less"

"case, after partial cell fusion, macronuclei disintegrate and each of"
"the two micronuclei undergoes meiosis, after which three of the.four"
nuclei from each cell abort. The remaining nucleus in each cell
"divides mitotically, one of the two nucle! from each cell passing into"

"_the other ‘in reciprocal fertilization. The cells separate, their nuclei"
"each divide mitotically twice, two nucle! reforming , the macronucleus"
while the other two regenerate the micronucleus. The significance of

"plants except gymnophytes and flowering plants (phanerogams), be-"
cause their organs of reproduction are not as prominent as in the
latter groups.

"Cryptopuyta. Division of Algae. Small group of unicellular algae,"
"mostly motile, with two slightly unequal flageHa emerging from a"
"sub-apical pit (gullet). Cells —dorsally-ventrally compressed, the major-"
ity “naked with ‘a firm cell membrane; others with cellulose wall.
"Reproduction by cell division. Variously pigmented, with chlorophylls"
"a and c, a and s-carotene, xanthophylls. In some genera, phycobilin"
pigments are distinct from those of the Cyanophyta and Rhodophyta.
"Food reserve starch or starch-like. A few heterotrophs occur, either"
saprotrophs or ingesting food particles. Occur in marine and fresh
water.

CryprorcHip. With testes not descended from abdominal cavity
into scrotum.

"CSF. See CEREBROSPINAL FLuID, COLONY STIMULATING"
FACTOR.

"Crenipia. Gills of mozzusca, situated in the mantle cavity."
"Involved in gaseous exchange, excretion, and/or filter-feeding."

"CtenopHora. Comb-jellies, sea-gooseberries. Subphylum of coE-"
"Lenterata; With-LASSO cetts, but no cnidoblasts. Body neither"
polyp nor medusa; movement by cilia fused in rows (combs or
ctenes); no asexual or sedentary phase. See cx Ip a x I a.

GCuttivar. Variety of plant found only under cultivation.

Cusp. Pointed projection on biting surface of mammalian molar
tooth. Each-cusp is termed a cone. Cusping pattern may have taxono-
mic value.

"Cuticte. Superficial non-cellular layer, covering and secreted by"
the epidermis of many plants and invertebrates (esp. terrestrial
"species). In plants, an external waxy layer covering outer walls of"
epidermal cells; in bryophytes and vascular plants comprises waxy
"compound, cutin, almost impermeable to water. In algae may contain"
other compounds. In higher plants cuticle is only interrupted by
stomata and lenticels. Its function is to protect against excessive
water loss as well as protecting against mechanical injury.
 

143 c VALUE

 

"The arthropod cuticle contains alpha-c x IT 1 n, proteins, lipids, and"
polyphenol oxidases involved in its tanning (sce SCLEROTIZATION).
Normally subdivisible into an outer non-chitinous epicuticle and an
inner chitinous procuticie (itself comprising an outer exocuticle and
an inner endocuticle). The epicuticle (1 ym thick in insects) is
"composed of cemented and polymerized lipoproteins, and affords"
good waterproofing and resistance to desiccation (less so in Ony-
"chophora), having been of utmost . importance in terrestrialization"
by insects. The endocuticles of decapod crustaceans are highly cal-
"cified, and often thick. In many arthropod larvae and sonie adults"
the cuticle remains soft and flexible (due largely to the protein
arthropodin) but at some hinges (¢.g. insect wing bases) another
"protein, resilin, enables greater flexibility still. Tanning hardens much"
"of the arthropod cuticle, producing sc tw ex ITES. Hardening is also"
brought about by water loss as the water-soluble arthropodin is
converted:to the insoluble protein sclerotin.

CUTICULARIZATION. Process of curtcte formation.

"Curtin. Fatty substance deposited in many plant cell walls, especially"
"on outer surface of epidermal cells, where it forms a layer called"
CUTICLE.

"CuTINIZATION. Impregnation of plant cell wall with curin. ,"
Cutis. Skin; in vertebrates comprises dermis and epidermis.

Curtine. Artificially detached plant part used in vegetative propaga-
tion.

"Cuvier, GEORGES (1769-1892). Professor of vertebrate zoology at the"
"Musée d’Histoire Naturelle in Paris (see 1 a u a x ¢ K). Polymath, special-"
izing in geology and palaeontology. Formed the premise that any
animal is so adapted to its environment (or conditions or existence)
that it can finetion successfully in that environment. All parts of the
animal therefore had to interrelate to forma viable whole; but certain
"parts are relatively invariant between organisms, and may therefore"
"have value in CLASSIFICATION. His was not, however, an evolu-"
"tionary system of classification, unlike Lamarck’s; it is -fairly clear"
that the two did not enjoy a cordial relationship. Cuvier had a gentus
for ‘reconstructing? a whole vertebrate skeleton from a single bone.

CYANELLE 144

 

"Cyanette. Endosymbiotic blue-green alga, , usually in association"
with protozoa.

"CYANOBACTERIA (CYANOPHYTA, MYXOPHYTA). Blue-green algae. Divi-"
"sion of the Monera, sharing general PROKARYOTI ¢ properties and"
"including unicellular, colonial and filamentous forms. Fossil blue-"
* greens make up layered formations called sTROMATOLITES.
"Probably first oxygen-producing organisms to evolve, responsible for"
"early accumulation of atmospheric oxygen. Related to sa c verza,"
"their photosynthetic apparatus includes both chlorophyll a, caro-"
tenoids and phycobiliprotein pigments contained in flattened mem-
branous sacs (thylakoids) scattered throughout the cell. Contain gly.
cogen as stored carbohydrate. Gelatinous sheath usually envelops the
"cells, distinctly red or blue depending on whether the cell is growing"
in respectively highly acid or alkaline conditions. Cell wall —construc-
tion and chemistry resemble those of Gram-negative — bacteria.

"Many planktonic blue-greens possess gas vesicles for cell buoyancy,"
"and many benthic species move when in contact with a solid surface,"
without evident organs of locomotion but probably either through
"secretion of mucilage from pores in the cell wall, or through con-"
tractile waves. Some species reproduce by cell division; in some
filamentous forms specialized.fragments of the filament (hormogonia)
serve in reproduction. Several unicellular reproductive agents are
"also formed by filamentous types: ax 1 Neves, endospores, exospores"
"and uererocysrs, the latter being the site of production of the"
"nitrogen-fixing enzyme nitrogenase. Sexual reproduction is not typical,"
but genetic recombination resembling that in bacterial conjugation
may take place.

"Widely distributed, occurring in waters of varying salinity, nutrient"
"status and temperature. Species found in plankton, benthos and"
aerial habitats. Generally more abundant in neutral or slightly al-
"kaline water, but also in alkaline hot springs. In nutrient-rich (eutro-"
"phic) lakes, several species often form late-summer stooms, e.g."
"Anabaena flos-aquae, Microcystis aeruginosa. Some strains of these"
species poison animals which drink the water. Can cause noxious
odours in stagnant waters. Many species form symbiotic _ relationships
"with other organisms, eg. with fungi (forming lichens), bryophytes,"
"ferns, seed plants and animals. Other than some bacteria, blue-"
greens are the only group of organisms capable of fixing atmospheric
nitrogen (See NITROGEN CYCLE).

"Cyanocopatamin (vitamin B,,). Cobalt- and nucleotide-containing"
"vitamin, synthesized only by some microorganisms. In vertebrates,"
carried across the gut wall by a glycoprotein (intrinsic factor) of
gastric juice. Essential for erythrocyte maturation and nucleotide

"Darwin, DARWINISM. Charles Robert Darwin (1809-1882) began"
"studying medicine at Edinburgh in 1825, but left after two years to"
study for the clergy at Cambridge. In 1831 the botanist J. §. Henslow
suggested to him that he might joinums Beagle on its survey of the
"South American coast, and in the same year he set sail on a momen-"
tous voyage lasting almost five years. In 1842 the Darwin family
"moved to Down House in Kent, where his most famous work The"
"Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection (published in 1859),"
"and other influential books, were written. In 1857 Darwin teceived a"
letter from Alfred Russel wa 1 ta c E indicating that the two men
we-te thinking along similar lines as to the mechanism of evolution —
"natural selection. After many years of ill health, Darwin died at"
"Down House on April 19th, 1882."

"In essence, Danvinism is the thesis that species are not fixed, either"
in form or number; that new species continue to arise while others
become extinct; that observed harmonies between an organism’s
structure and way of life are. neither coincidental nor necessarily
"proof of the existence of a benevolent deity, but that any apparent"
design is inevitable given: (a) the tendency of all organisms to over-
"produce, despite the limited nature of resources (eg. food) available"
to them; (b) that few individuals of a species are precisely alike in any
measurable variable; (c) that some at least of this variance is heritable;
and (d)} that some of the differences between individuals must result in
"a largely unobserved selective mortality, or ‘struggle for existence’, to"
"which (a} must lead. Moreover, he argued, the ‘struggle’ is likely to be"
"most intense between individuals of the same species, their needs"
being most similar. Darwin's metaphor ‘struggle’ caused much con-
"fusion, but his more abstract phrase for the mechanism of evolution,"
"NaturaL sEtection, has survived the test of time."

Much of the theoretical input for the theory of evolution by
"natural selection came from Lyell’s Principles of Geology (1830),"
"which Darwin took on ums Beagle, and Malthus’s Essay on the"
"Principle of Population (1798), which he read ‘for amusement’ in 1838."
The chief empirical influences included observations on the fauna
"and flora of the Galapagos archipelago, ‘so similar to - yet distinct"
"from - those on the mainland, the fossil armadillos and ground"
"sloths of Patagonia, and the effects of ARTIFICIAL SELECT-ION on"
domesticated plants and animals. Darwinism argues for common
genealogical links between living and fossil organisms. Darwin gave
an unconvincing account of the origin and nature of phenotypic
"variation, so essential to his theory, and had rather little to say on"

Decomposer. ANY uerzrorrops breaking down dead organic
matter to simpler organic or inorganic material. In some E COSYS-

ves the .decomposer food chain is energetically more important

"carbon intake as CO, and the heat release,-as evidenced by compost"
"heaps, can be considerable;- a useful aspect is that most pathogenic"
"bacteria and cysts, eggs, and immature forms of plant and animal"
"parasites that may have been present, as in sewage, are killed."

An important factor in composting is the carbon to nitrogen ratio. A
ratio of about 30 : 1 (by weight} 1s optimal: any higher and microbial
growth slows. Because composting greatly reduces the bulk of plant
"wastes, it can be very useful in waste disposal."

"of NEGATIVE FEEDBACK system, some have suggested that ECOSYS-"
TEMS might Self-regulate by this sort of process. See BALANCE oF
NATURE. CONTACT INHIBITION by cells is a form of density-
dependent inhibition of tissue growth.

DENSITY GRADIENT CENTRIFUGATION. Procedure whereby cell compo-
"nents (nuclei, organelles) and macromolecules can be separated by"

ultracentrifugation in caesium chloride Of sucrose solutions whose
densities increase progressively along (down) the centrifuge tube. Can
be used to separate and hence distinguish different DNA molecules
on the basis of whether or not they have incorporated heavy nitrogen
(‘*N) atoms. Cell components or macromolecules cease sedimenting
when they reach solution densities that match their own buoyant
densities.

DENTAL FORMULA. Formula indicating for a mammal species the
number of each kind of tooth it has. The number in upper jaw of one
side only is written above that in lower jaw of the same side.

155 DESMQSOMES

 

"Desert. A major s romz, characterized by little rainfall and conse-"
quently little or no plant cover. Included are the cold deserts of polar
"regions, such as tundra and areas covered by permanent snow and"
"ice. Hot deserts have very high temperatures, offen exceeding 36°C in"
the summer months. Rainfall may be less than 100 mm per year.
Deserts can be extensive: the African Sahara is the world’s largest;
Australian deserts cover some 44% of the continent. Annual plants
"(desert ephemerals) are most important in these conditions, both"
numerically and in kind. They have a rapid growth cycle which can
"be completed quickly when water is available, seeds surviving in"
desert soils during periods of drought. Perennials that do occur are
mostly bulbous and dormant for most of the time. Taller perennials
are either succulents (e.g. cacti) or possess tiny leaves that are

leathery or shed during periods of drought. Many succulents exhibit
"CRASSULACEAN ACID METABOLISM, absorbingcarbondioxideat"
night. See osmorecunation.

Desmiv. Informal term referring to.two orders of freshwater green
algae (Chlorophyta) whose cell walls are porate and in two sections
"united by a narrow constriction or isthmus. Cells may be solitary,"
"joined end to end in filamentous colonies, or united in amorphous"
"colonies. Their taxonomy is complicated by polymorphism, species"
sometimes having more than one appearance. Cells possess a single
nucleus and two chloroplasts. Mucilage is secreted through pores in
"the cell wall and is responsible for movement and, when copiously"
"secreted, for adherence to the substrate (commonly as epiphytes)."
Barium sulphate crystals occur within a vacuole at the tip of cells in
some genera. Sexual reproduction involves c Os s Us a ot Ow and pro-
duction of amoeboid gametes. Spines develop upon the zygote walls
"and germinate meiotically, completing the life cycle. Desmids are"
"usually indicators of relatively unpolluted water, with low calcium"
and magnesium and slightly acidic pH. Compare diatoms (@ a c rut om =

IOPHYTA). )

DESMIN. An oinvermeprate = Fitamenr protein characteristic of
"smooth, striated and cardiac muscle cells and fibres. In sarcomeric"
muscle it may help to link the Z-discs together; in smooth muscle it
probably serves to anchor cells together. Also a prominent component
of fibres on the cytoplasmic side of pzsmosomes .

Desmosomes. One kind of INTERCELLULAR JUNCTION (see Fig.37)
found typically where animal cells need firm attachment to one
another against severe stress which would tear or shear tissues. A belt
desmgsome (zonula adhaerens} comprises a band of contractile a c 1 1 n
"filaments near the apical end of each epithelial cell, just under the cell"
membrane. A sheet of cells so united may roll up to form a tube by
contraction of these filaments ~ as in neural tube formation. Spot
desmosomes are sites of keratin filament attachment on the inner cell
 

DESMOTUBULE 156

 

#NAME?
"and connected to those in other cells, spot desmosomes being paired"
in adjacent cells.. Hemidesmosomes link keratin attachment sites of
epithelial cells to the. underlying Basar LAMIN a; like spot des-
"mosomes, they are rivet-like, and probably transfer stress from the"

epithelium to the underlying connective tissue via the basal lamina.
See CYTOSKELETON.

"DesmoTUBULE. The tubule that ' traverses a plasmodesmatal canal,"
uniting the endoplasmic reticulum of two adjacent plant cells.

"been irreversibly fixed. See COMPETENCE, oncantzer, POSITIONAL"
"INFORMATION, PRESUMPTIVE."

DETRITUS. Organic debris from decomposing organisms and. their
products. The source of nutrient and energy input for the detritus
foodchain. See  vecomposzr.

"DEUTEROMYCOTINA. Formal subdivision of the fungi (gumycora),"
"commonly known as fungi imperfecti. They all lack a sexual stage,"
"thereby lying outside the remainder of fungal classification, heavily"
based as it is upon sexual reproduction. Some species may be secon-
"darily non-sexual, others possibly . never possessed a sexual stage."
Generally believed to be non-sexual stages (anamorphs) of fungi
"belongingtothe ascomycormva and saszpromycormna, the largest"
"number in the former category. Frequently, a sexual stage is dis-"
"covered later, both stages (anamorph and telomorph) then being"
"transferred to the, group to which the telomorph belongs. Deu-"
teromycetes occur in virtually every habitat and on every type of
substratum. Many are saprotrophs in soil; many are plant and
animal parasites (eg. causing such-diseases as ringworm and athlete’s
"foot), . some occur in flowing water. Many moulds are included,"
some ‘of commercial importance (e.g. Penicillium roquefortii and P.
"camembertii in cheese production, Aspergillus oryzae in production of"
"soy paste, or miso). Deuteromycete moulds grow prolifically on"
"artificial media and are widely used in genetic, biochemical and"
nutritional research. Strains of the genus Penicillium produce anti-
"biotics, while large species of Aspergillus produce citric acid when"
grown under very acidic conditions.

"DeUTEROSTOMIA, That assemblage of coelomate animals (some call it"
an infragrade) in which the embryonic BLASTOPORE becomes the

Diasetes. (1) Diabetes insipidus. An uncommon disorder in which
a copious urine arises usually owing to a person’s inability to secrete
"ANTIDIURETIC uornone. (2) Diabetes mellitus (or simply,"
diabetes). The insulin-dependent form of this disease generally pre-
"sents fairly early in life, due either to inability of the pancreas to"
"secrete I NSUL 1, of to insensitivity of the appropriate target tissues"
to it. A classic symptom is presence of glucose in the urine (glyco-
suria). Twin studies indicate that the uzrrrasrurry of this form is
"not simple, and that it may be triggered by various factors. Twin"
studies also indicate that the form of the disorder which presents
"later in life, which is not insulin-dependent and may be treated by"
"dietary pattem, has high heritability."

DiapetpHous. (Of stamens) united by their filaments to form two
"groups, or having one solitary and the others united; e.g. pea."
"Compare MONADELPHOUS, POLYADELPHOUS."

Diaceortropism. Orientation of plant part by growth curvature in

Diakinesis. Final stage in the first prophase of mezosrs.
 

 

DIALYSIS 158

 

"Diatysis. Method of separating small molecules (e.g. salts, urea)"
"from large (e.g. proteins, polysaccharides) when in mixed solution,"
by placing the mixture in or repeatedly passing it through a semi-
"pertheable bag or dialysis’ tube, eg. made of cellophane; surrounded"
by distilled water (which itself may be removed and replaced). Small
", molecules will diffuse out of the mixture. into the surrounding water,"
" whereas. large molecules are prevented by.. size from doing So. The
principle underlies the design of artificial kidneys, which work by
renal dialysis.

Diarause. Term used to indicate period of suspended development
in insects (and occasionally in other invertebrates). In insects, usually
atrue vo rman ¢ y, implying a condition rather than a stage in
morphogenesis. Insect diapause can occur at any stage in develop-
ment, perhaps most commonly in eggs or pupae, but usually only
once in any fifé cycle.

DiapHracm. Sheet of tissue, part muscle and part tendon, covered by
a serous membrane and separating thoracic and abdominal cavities
in mammals only. It is arched up at rest, its flattening during
inspiration reducing the pressure within the thorax, helping to draw
air into the lungs. See vewrzzarzon.

DiAPHysis. Shaft of a long ‘limb ‘bone, or “central portion ‘of* a
vertebra, in mammals. Contains an ‘extended osstrrcarron centre.
See EPIPHYSIS.

Diapsip. Vertebrate skull type in which two openings, one in the
tbof and one in the cheek, appear on each side. The feature is found
in many reptiles (cg. ARCHOSAURS) and all birds.

DIASTASE. See AMYLASES .

Diastote. Brief period in the vertebrate wzarRr cycte When both
atria and ventricles are relaxed, and the heart refills with blood from
the veins. The term may also be used of relaxation of atria and
ventricles, separately; in which case the terms atrial diastole and
ventricular diastole are used, and are not to be confused with true
diastole. Compare sysrote.

DICHOTOMOUS VENATION. Branching of leaf veins into two more or
lessequal parts, without any fusion after they have branched.

Dicnotomy, Branching, or bifurcation, into two equal portions. Djeho-
tomous keys ate employed in those identification manuals where one
passes along a path dictated by. consecutive decisions, each choice
being binary (there being just two altematives) one route involving
thestrictnegationofthe other. See IDENTIFICATION KEYS,” ,

DicoTYLEDONAE. Larger of the two classes of ANTHOPHYTA (flower
ing plants); distinguished from Mpnocotyledonae by presence,of two
leaves (¢ 0 T ¥ 1 E DONS) in ‘the embryo, by usually netlike leaf vena-
tion, by stem vascular tissue in theform of a ring of open bundles, and
by flower parts in multiples of four or five. Pollen, is usually tricolpate
(having three furrows or pores), and commonly there is true secondary
growth with a vascular cambium present. There are about 170 000
species, including many types of forest tree, potatoes,? beans, cabbages,
and such omamentals as roses, clematis and  snapdragon.

Dictyoptera. Insect order containing the cockroaches and mantids,
a group sometimes’ included in the O re Tx Oe T Bra. Largely terrestrial;

DirFeRENTIATION. The process whereby cells or cell clones assume
specialized functional biochemistries and morphologies previously
absent. Such determined cells usually lose the ability to divide. Usually
associated with the selective expression of parts of the genome
previously unexpressed, brought on eg. by cell contact, cell density,
the extracellular matrix and molecules diffusing in it, etc. Division
of labour thus achieved is one evolutionary by-product of sourr «
CELLULARITY.

DirFusE Porous woop. Wood in which pores, or vessels, are fairly
uniformly distributed throughout the growth layers; or in which the
size of pores changes only slightly from early to late wood; eg. tulip
tree (Liriodendron tulipifera).
 

DIFFUSION 160

 

Dirrusion. Tendency for particles (esp. atoms, molecules) , of gases,
liquids, and solutes to disperse randomly and occupy available space.
Process is accelerated by rise of temperature, the source of movement
being thermal agitation. Cells and organisms are dependent on the
process at many of their surfaces and interfaces; on its own it is often
inadequate for their needs. Sec acrrve TRANSPORT, FACILITATED
DIFFUSION, OSMOSIS, WATER POTENTIAL. ,

Dicenea. Order’of the rremarona. Includes those flukes which are
usually vertebrate endoparasites as adults and mollusc  endoparasites
as sporocysts and rediae. Suckers simple. E.g. Fasciola, scx 1$T0 -
SOMA.

Dicestion. “Breakdown by organisms, ultimately to small organic
compounds, of complex nutrients that are either acted upon outside
the organism (e.g. by saprotrophs}, or have entered some organelle
(e.g. food vacuole} or organ (enteron, gut) specialized for the purpose.
Often includes the physical events of chewing and emulsification
besides chemical breakage of covalent bonds by mineral acids and
enzymes. Food molecules are often too large simply to diffuse across
cett mempranes and their digestion is first required. A gut forms
a tube to confine ingested material while extracellular enzymes hy-
drolyse it, given appropriate conditions (e.g. pH, temperature). Later
stages of digestion may occur through enzymes located in the brush
borders of intestinal epithelia (as with nucleotidases and disac-
charidases; see MICROVILLUS). After digestion, molecules are in-
corporated (assimilated) into cells of the body. Although plants lack
guts, their cells can digest contained material (e.g: polysaccharides,
lipids; see tysosom) . Although both digestion and RESPIRATION
are catabolic, and-digestion like some respiration is anaerobic, diges-
tion does not release significant amounts of energy.

Diait. Finger or toe of vertebrate pen rapACTYL LimB. Contains
phalanges. May bear nails, claws or hooves.

DieitigraDE. Walking on toes, rather than on whole foot (PLANTI-
¢ re av &). Only the ventral surfaces of digits used. E.g. cat, dog.

Dinvyerip CROSS. A cross between two organisms or stocks heterozygous
for the same alleles at the same two loci under study. A classic
example was sz npz u's crossing of Fl pea plants obtained as pro-
geny from plants homozygous for different alleles at two such loci.
This gave his famous 9 : 3 : 3: 1 ratio of phenotypes (often called
the dihybrid ratio), but by no means all dihybrid crosses give this
ratio. The phrase dihybrid segregation is often used to describe the
production of these ratios. Dihybrid selfing may be possible in some
hermaphrodites (e.g. peas) and monoecious plants. Contrast
MONOHYBRID CRosS. See LINKAGE.

Dikarvon (DICARYON), Fungal hypha or mycelium in which cells
 

161 DIPLOPODA

 

occur containing two haploid nuclei which undergo simultaneous
‘division ‘during formation of each new cell. This forms a third,
dikaryotic phase (dikaryophase) interposed between haploid and
dipluid‘phases in the life cycle. Occurs in Ascomycotina, where it is
“usually brief, and in the Basidiomycotina, where. it is of relatively

long duration. The paired nuclei may be genetically identical, or non-
identical. See  monoxaryon.

Dimonpuism, Of members of.a species, structures, etc., existing in two
clearly separable, forms. E.g. sexual dimorphism, often very pro-

nounced, between the two sexes; heterophylly in some plants (e.g. water
crowfoot), in which leaves in two different environments have different

jelly-like mesogloea separates the layers.

Dipcoww. Nuclei (and their cells) in which the chromosomes occur as
homologous pairs (though rarely paired up), so that twice the nar »
LO « v number is present. Also applicable to appropriate tissues,
organs, organisms and phases in a life cycle (see s ep on OP # ¥ m).
Most somarte certs of animals are diploid (see maze HAP-
tory), but some of the cells of the cermmwan  eprruetium
engage in MEIOSIS; giving haploid products. See anrerwarion oF

(Compositae); contrasted with the flattened, zygomorphic ray-shaped
florets on the margins of the head.

Disinrectant. Substance used particularly on inanimate surfaces
to kill microorganisms, thus sterilizing them. Hypochlorites, pheno-
lics, iodophores (complexes of iodine less staining, toxic and  imitant
than iodine solutions) and detergents all have disinfectant ability.
The phenolic hexachlorophene is widely used in the food industry and
hospital wards to reduce pathogenic staphylococci. See anrzszerre .

munity (its richness) is a poor indicator of community structure. Few
species out of the total present are usually abundant (ie. have a large
population size, a large biomass, productivity, or some other measure
of importance).The large number of rare species mainly determines
the species diversity, and ratios between the number of species and
their ‘importance values’ are termed species diversity indices. The
particular index employed varies with the type of community _ studied.

DIVERTICULUM. Blind-ending tubular or sac-like outpushing from a
cavity, often from the gut,

DIZYGOTIC TWINS. See FRATERNAL TWINS.

DNA (pEoxyriponucteic acip). The nucleic acid forming the gene-
tic material of all cells, some organelles, and many viruses; a major
component of curomosomzs and the sole component of pras-
u ws. A polymer (polynucleotide), which is formed in cells by en-
zymatic dephosphorylation and conpensarron of many (de-
oxyribo)NUCLEOSIDE rripuosruares (esp. dATP, dGTP,
dC TP, dTTP). The product is a long chain of (deoxyribo)-NUC =
tL E 0171 D Es, bonded covalently by phosphodiester bonds. Duplex D N A
comprises two such antiparallel strands (running in opposite direc-
tions, see Fig. 13) but complementary in base composition, and held
together in a double helix by hydrogen bonds between the comple--
mentary bases, by electronic interactions between bases, and by
hydrophobic interactions. Each strand comprises a sugar- phosphate
backbone from which the bases project inwardly. (Each end of the
double helix has one S-ending strand paired to a 3’-ending strand,
where the 5’ and 3’ indicate which carbon atoms of the two terminal
deoxyriboses are bonded to, their ‘terminal phosphate group.) It is as
duplex DNA that nuclear DNA is normally found, and this form is
the ultimate store of molecular information for all cells (but single-
stranded DNA sacrertopuaces eccur) . Unlike RNA, DNA is
not hydrolysed by dilute alkali. Two of the bases abundant in the
nucleotides of DNA are purines (adenine and guanine), that form
hydrogen bonds with two common pyrimidines (thymine and cytosine
respectively, see 8 a's ee ad eaiw Gy. This ability of one strand of duplex
DNA to act as template for the other enables DNA to be replicated
by DNA POLYMERASEin a semiconservative way (see DNAREPLICA-
TION). A combination of X-ray crystallographic and chemical data
(see sasz ratzo) led J. Watson and F. Crick in 1953 to propose
the three-dimensional model of duplex DNA held today. see DE-

DNA PROBE. A defined and fairly- short DNA sequence, isotopically or

DNA repair Mecuanisms. Some bacterial and eukaryotic DNA poLy-
MER a SE s- can replace a nucleotide they insert incorrectly. p w a
t 1G ase then seals the phosphodiester bond. To avoid removing the
nucleotide from- the wrong (1.e. error-free) strand, cells methylate
DNA which has been formed some while; repair enzymes thus
distinguish old from new DNA, and repair only the new strand
error. Mutants lacking such repair mechanisms are likely to be more
susceptible to irradiating sources and to express (somatic) mutations
so induced. In photoreactivation, cells of many organisms (but appar-
ently not of placental mammals) repair radiation-damaged DNA (as
from UV light) using an enzyme that functions “when exposed to
strong visible light. The main damage products are pyrimidine dimers
formed by linking adjacent pyrimidines in the same DNA strand.
The photoreactivating enzyme monomerizes these dimers again. See
CROSSING-OVER.
 

 

 

DNA REPLICATION 166

DNA reptication. Almost universal biological processes, in which
DNA duplexes are catalytically and semiconservatively teplicated by a
DNA POLYMERASE (sce MULTIENZYME COMPLEX) at rates of
between 50-500 nucleotides per second. The duplex is first ‘unzipped’
by breaking the hydrogen bonds holding base-pairs in the duplex

together. The resulting Y-shaped molecule is termed a replication
fork. DNA polymerases then move down the two single-stranded
arms in a 5’-to-3’ direction (see pnay, incorporating nucleotides in
accordance with sasz parr ING rules. Energy is supplied by hy-
drolysis of substrate nucleoside triphosphates, also catalysed by the
polymerase. There are usually several simultaneous replication forks
on one replicating chromosome, and newly-synthesized sections are
joined up by the D N A figase component of the polymerase (see
DNA REPAIR MECHANISMS). ‘Failure to replicate exactly results in a
MUTATION.

DNase (DNAase, DEOXYRIBONUCLEASE). An enzyme (of which there
are many forms) breaking down DNA by hydrolysis of the phospho-
diester bonds of its sugar-phosphate backbone. Depending on the
enzyme, it does this at either the 3’- or the 5’- end of the bond. As
with peptidases, there are endonucleases and exonucleases, cleaving
respectively terminal and non-terminal nucleotides from either a
single strand or from both strands of the duplex, depending on the
type of DNase. Pancreatic juice contains D Nases. Valuable in cznz

Some subtle and elaborate methods are available.

DOLLO’s Law. The generalization that evolution does not proceed
back along its own path, or repeat routes.

Dominance. (1) In genetics, one character is said to be completely
dominant to another when it is expressed equally in the homozygous
and heterozygous conditions; the other character is said to be com-
pletely xe c ess [ ve to it, and is only expressed in the homozygous
condition. Normally, the two characters would form what Mendel
termed a ‘pair of contrasting characters’; they would, in other words,
be determined by alternative alleles at the same locus, Genetic domi-
nance is not synonymous with ‘commonest character type in the
population’: that will depend upon sz 1z c¢ TION, amongst other fac-
tors. The term is often used of genes (or alleles), but since a ‘gene’
can have more than one effect (see » 1 et OTRO Py) accuracy requires
 

167 “ DORMANT

 

use of the term to be restricted either to the context of characters,-or
to’ one particular aspect of phenotype affected by the gene. Domin-
arice is usually a property of a normally functional (‘wild type) allele;

defective (mutant) ‘alleles are usually, ‘but not always, recessive. In

some cases the-degree of dominance is altered by selection when it is

“an evolving property of-characters (see DOMINANCE MODIFICATION,

MODIFIER). Two characters are said to be Cédominant when the
respective homozygotes are distinguishable both from each other and
from ‘the heterozygote, and where the effects of both alleles can be
detected in the phenotype; two characters are said to be incompletely
dominant to one another when the heterozygote is distinguishable
from both homozygotes, but distinct effects of the two alleles in the
phenotype are not ‘recognizable.‘

There can be no dominance in the H aP LO] D ‘state, or in the
HEMIZYGOUS Condition generally..

: (2) In animal behaviour, a relational property indicating one in-
dividual’s priority over another in contexts where some resource (e.g.
food, mate, shelter) either is, or has in the past been, contested.

(3) In ecology, out of hundreds of organisms, present in a com-
munity only a relatively few species or species groups generally exert
the major controlling influence by virtue of their numbers (abun-
dance), size, production, etc.; species or species groups which largely
control the energy -flow as well as affecting the environment of all
other species are known as the, dominant species, e.g. beech trees in a
beech wood. When more than one dominant species or species group
occurs in a particular’ plant community, they are called codominants.

DOmINANCE. MQDIFICATION. Phenomenon whereby different popula-
tions of a species’ evolve different genetic backgrounds (see MODI-
FIER) by which phenotypic effects of the same genetic mutation are
expressed as either pommnanr or RECESSI VE. Crossing between
individuals from such populations may result in breakdown of domin-
ance, producing an unclassifiable range of phenotypes.

DORMIN 168

productive bodies (e.g. resting spores such as statoblasts, fungal
sclerotia, bacterial spores). May be due to unfavourable conditions,
and end as these ameljorate. Many seeds (e.g. pea, wheat), though
capable of germinating after harvesting, do not do so unless kept
moist. On the other hand, a dormant period is part of an annual
rhythm for most plants. Often has survival value (e.g. winter dor-
mancy in deciduous trees). After vegetative growth and flowering in
spring, many bulbs (eg. snowdrop, daffodil) have a dormant period
coinciding with conditions favourable to growth of other plants. This
is common in plants of moist, tropical climates. Dormancy of seeds
in conditions otherwise favourable to germination is common (e.g.
hawthorn, the weed wild oats) and is associated with incomplete
development of the embryo, impermeable seed coats, limiting entry
of water and/or oxygen, inhibitors and absence of growth stimulators.
Dormancy in some seeds and deciduous trees is regulated by photo-
period (see PHYTOCHROME). See AESTIVATION, DIAPAUSE,

is maintained on, both sides of the eardrum. [pn it” lie the zar

OSSICLES.

Ear OSSICLES. Bones in middle ear connecting eardrum to twner

zAx in tetrapod vertebrates. Instead of just the single auditory bone
(stapes, see’ conumetza) of amphibia and primitive reptiles, mam-
mals have in addition the incus and malleus. The first retains its
original attachment to the oval window of the inner ear, but here
articulates via the incus with the malleus which attaches to the
eardrum (tympanum). These last two bones have evolved re-
spectively from the quadrate and articular bones of mammal-like
reptiles, in which they were involved in jaw suspension. By this
articulation the pressure of the stapes on the oval-window is amplified
22 times compared with that of the pressure waves on the tympanum:
vibrations are damped, but produce larger forces.

Ear, outer (or external). That part of the tetrapod ear, absent

from amphibians and some reptiles, external to the eardrum. Corm-

prises a bony tube (external auditory meatus). In addition in mammals
there is a flap of skin and cartilage (the pinna) at the outer opening
which amplifies and focuses pressure waves upon the eardrum. Well
developed in noctumal mammals (eg. bats).

EarRDRUM (TYMPANUM, TYMPANIC memBRaNne). Thin membrane
stretching across the aperture between skull bones at the surface of
the head (most anurans and turtles) or within an external meatus
(most reptiles, birds and mammals). Vibrates, often aperiodically;
transmitting external air pressure changes to zar osstcizs of middle
ear cavity.

Ecav. (Bot.) A habitat form, showing characteristics imposed by
habitat conditions and non-genetic. Compare scorvez.

Ecpysis. Moulting in arthropods. Periodic shedding of the currciz

in the course. of growth. In insects this includes much of the lining of
the tracheal system. The number of larval moults varies (up to 14 in
APTERYGOTA); in endopterygotes there is one pupal moult (produc-
ing adult), but among insects only apterygotans moult as adults. In
most crustaceans it proceeds throughout adult life. Insect ecdysis is
under the control of ECDYSONE.

ECDYSONE (MOULTING HORMONE, GROWTH-ANO-DIFFERENTIATION HOR-
mone). Hormone produced by-insect thoracic (prothoracic) glands,
and possibly‘also by the crustacean Y-organ. In insects its release is
under the control of thoracotropic hormone produced by neuro-
secretory cells in the brain and released from the CORPORA
carptaca. In crustaceans the brain neurosecretion is produced in
the X-organs and transported to the sinus glands of the eye-stalk. Its
release inhibits release of moulting hormone by the Y-organs. In
insects at least ecdysone induces ‘puffing’ of selected chromosome
regions, the sequence being tissue-specific. This is associated with
selective gene transcription, notably by the epidermis, but one of its
major effects is to make appropriate cells sensitive to juvenile hormone
from the corpora atzara, With which ecdysone works to bring
about moulting to the appropriate developmental stage. See pia-
PAUSE.

pounds, and the climatic regime (temperature, rainfall and other
physical factors). The biotic components generally include repre-
sentatives from several rroparc LEVELS; primary producers (auto-
trophs, mainly green plants), macroconsumers (heterotrophs, mainly
animals} which ingest other organisms or particulate organic matter,
microconsumers (saprotrophs, again heterotrophic, mainly bacteria

ELECTRON MICROSCOPE 176

 

ELECTRON Microscope. See MICROSCOPE.

ELECTRON TRANSPORT SYSTEM {ETS, ELECTRON TRANSPORT CHAIN).
Chain of specifically and adjacently arranged enzymes (mostly con-
jugated proteins, e.g. CYTOCHROMES) and associated COENZYMES
embedded in an ion-impermeable membrane, along which electrons
pass by REDOX reactions from one to the next (see Fig. 14). During

_ this passage, electrons fall from higher to lower redox potentials
(energy states). Because, of the positioning of these proteins in the
membrane, energy so released is used, to pump protons across the
membrane, resulting in a proton gradient which itself acts as a store
of potential energy. As the protons retum down their electrochemical
gradient through specific channelsin the membrane, they provide the
“protonmotive force necded for ATP synthesis‘by ATPase, itself associ-
ated with the proton channels. This process is common to the’inner
‘membranes of MITOCHONDRIA and the thylakoid system of CHLORO-
PLASTS. In chloroplasts the electrons are first boosted to a high
energy level by photons; in mitochondria they are derived from
hydrogen atoms (also the proton source) covalently bonded in
electron-rich respiratory substrates. Associated coenzymes, not all
intrinsic to the membrane, may include NAD, NADP, FAD, flavo-
proteins, plastoquinone’and ubiquinone. Similar ETS§s occur in bac:
terial membranes (e.g. see BACTERIORHODOPSIN).

“ different net charges at a given pH) in an electric field generated by
direct current through the buffer. Substances for separation are
usually allowed to move through a porous medium such as a gel (eg.
starch, agar, polyacrylamide) or paper (eg. filter, cellulose acetate).
Separated substances occur in bands on the medium and may be
stained or identified by some labelling device, by fluorescence, by
comparisonswith knowns, or by removal and subsequent analysis. In
immunoelectrophoresis antigens are placed in wells cut in agar gel.
After separation of antigens by electrophoresis a trough is cut be-
tween the wells, filled with antibody, and diffusion allowed to take
place. Where antigen meets appropriate antibody, arcs of precipitin
form, allowing complex antigen mixtures to be compared.

Emascutation. Removal of stamens from hermaphrodite flowers
before they have liberated their pollen, usually as a preliminary to
artificial hybridization.

Emseooinc. Method employed in the preparation of permanent
microscope slides of thin tissue sections. After DEHYDRATION and
CLEARING, the material is put into molten paraffin wax (usually for
1-3 hours, with one or two changes of wax) which impregnates the
tissue. After setting, the wax block is sectioned using a MICROTOME.

Evo.ution. (1) Microevolution: changes in appearance of popuiations
and species over generations. (2) Macroevolution ot phyletic evolution:
origins and zxrrerross of species and grades (see  srzcrarron) .

"Microevolution includes changes in mean and modal phenotype,"
"morph ratios, etc. such as occur within populations from one genera-"
tion to the next. When statistically significant changes in such vari-
"‘ables (or the genes responsible for them) occur with time, a population"
may be said to evolve. Macroevolution includes large-scale phyletic
change over geological time (€g. successive otigins of crossopterygian
"fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals), as well as extinctions"
of taxa within such groups. It is usually accepted that causes of
evolutionary change include warorna szuectron and cewnerre
"parr, and that-macroevolutionary change can be explained by the"
same factors that bring about  microevolution.

Debate has recently centred upon the rate of evolutionary change.
Some biologists accept that evolution largely occurs by gradual
' amacmesrs; Others stress the role of c1apcomes:s and take the
"view that species persist unchanged for considerable periods of time,"
and that relatively rapid speciation events punctuate the fossil record
(punctuated equilibrium). Darwin considered both to be possibilities.
"At the molecular level, controversy centres on the respective influ-"
ences in evolution of random alterations in genetic material (the
 

195 EXARCH

 

neufralist view) and of selective changes (the selectionist view). See
“ motecurar ctock. Opposed to evolutionary explanations of the

composition of the Earth’s fauna and flora is the group of views

"termed ‘special creationism’, which holds that there are no bonds of"

"genetic relationship between species, past or present: See ortem oF"
LIFE.

"Although Anaximander (6th. cen. ac), Empedocles (5th. cen. 2c)"
"and Aristotle (4th. cen. 2c) all held evolutionary views of some kind,"
they depended more on apriorism than on observation and testable
theory. tamarcx is often considered the.. most influential evolu-
tionary thinker prior to Charles DARWIN and Alfred WALLACE but
his theory was very different from theirs. They themselves drew apart
on the question of human origins and the role of sexual selection.

Evidence for the fact of macroevolution comes principally from
"comparative morphology (especially anatomy and embryology), from"
"geographical distributions of organisms, and from fossil records. The"
modern theory of evolution (NEO-DARWINISM) derives largely from
"the kind of genetical knowledge which Darwin lacked, principally — the"
"occurrence of Mendelian segregation, which helps-explain how  varia-"
tions can be maintained in populations. Evidence for recency of
common ancestry of taxa now comes especially from DNA sequenc-
ing and hybridization. Evidence for microevolution and Darwinian
natural selection (amounting to his ‘special theory of evolution’)
stems largely from population genetics (e.g. see INDUSTRIAL MELA-
"wisM), although Darwin himself drew, heavily on the analogy of"
ARTIFICIAL SELECTION. See NATURAL SELECTION.

EVOLUTIONARILY sTaBLe stratecy (ess). A heritable strategy
"(commonly, but by no means always behavioural) which, if adopted"
"by (expressed in) most members of a population, cannot be sup-"
planted in evolution by an alternative (mutant) strategy. The strategy
may be complex arid involve a variety of different sub-responses in
"accordance with environmental changes, not least other organisms’"
behaviours. See GAME cuzory.

Evotutionary taxonomy. A school of biological CLASSIFICATION

EXCRETION 196

 

Excretion. (1) Any process by which an organism- gets rid of waste
metabolic products. Differs from zczsrron in that wastes removed
are products of the organism’s cells rather than simply undigested
wastes; and from secRerron since substances produced would gen-
"erally be harmful if allowed to accumulate, and as a rule have no"
intrinsic value to the organism. The simplest excretory method is
"passive diffusion, either through the normal body surface or across"
"organs with enlarged surface areas (gills, Jungs). These may be"
"supplemented or replaced by internal excretory organs, particularly"
where the body surface cannot be used. Excretory organs typically
"remove metabolic products from interstitial fluids (e.g. lymph, blood"
"plasma). The gut occasionally serves as a route for,excretory products,"
but is not an excretory organ. Nitrogenous excretion is usually in the

"form of ammonia (aquatic environments), urea (terrestrial environ-"

ments) or uric acid (environments where water is at a premium).
"Common. invertebrate excretory organs include riame cents, NEPH-"
"ripia, and MALPIGHIAN rusuzes, but in some cases (e.g. large"
"crustaceans) excretion may be deposited in the exoskeleton,"
commonly to be lost during moulting. Vertebrate xrpyzevs work by
"filtration and selective reabsorption, and, like some invertebrate"
"excretory organs, also have roles in osmorecuzatton."

Excretion in plants includes GUTTATION and removal by diffusion
"of excess oxygen produced by photosynthesis, since oxygen may"
inhibit that process. Leaf fall also removes a number of metabolic
"wastes. (2) A-substance, or mixture of substances, excreted: excreta."

"Exerconic, (Of a chemical reaction) yielding energy. See THERMO-"

Exotoxin. Toxin released by a microorganism into surrounding
growth medium or tissue during growth phase of infection. Generally
inactivated by heat and easily neutralized by specific antibody.

Experiment. The intentional manipulation of material conditions
"so as to elicit an answer to a question, often posed in the form: what"
is the effect of x on y? The aim of the experimenter is to isolate x as

might affect the value of y. Values of x can then be paired off with
"values of y, when changes in x are said to be the cause of any"
"changes in y, A similar approach compares the results of two experi-"
"mental situations differing in just one initial condition, which often"
has zero value in one of the experimental situations (called- the
control) but is allowed free range .over its values in the other experi-

mental situation (called the experiment). The effeots of this free- .
ranging variable are then compared with the effect of its absence
"(zero value), and since it is the only independent variable, any  differ-"
ences in effect can be said to have been caused by changes’ in its

value. Controlled experiments must have this‘ comparative element.
The rationale is to climinate all possible -altemative causes of effects
save the one under investigation. Without such controlled. experi-
ments’ the material causes of phenomena couldé&never be ascertained.
"It is often assumed, not always with justification, that methods used"
to study biological. material da not themselves affect the properties
being studied. .

Extinction. Termination of a genealogical lineage. Used most fre-

and random fluctuations ‘in population — size.

"There have been four periods of so-called mass extinction, during"
"which the Earth’s fauna has suffered extinction rates far higher than,"
"the normal background rate. These occurred in the Ordovician, the"
"late Devonian, the late Permian (225 Myr BP), the late Triassic (190"
"Myr BP) and the late Cretaceous/Tertiary (K/T, 65 Myr BP). Possible"
causes of greater than normal extinction rates include evolutionary
"competition, geological (eg. volcanic) and climatic change and com-"
etary or other impact. Victims of the K/T extinction included the
"dinosaurs and 60-75% of all marine species, and evidence (high"
iridium levels and soot in clays at the K/T boundary) suggests that
cometary impact could have -resulted in large-scale fire. This could
"have released huge volumes of ones of nitrogen into the atmosphere,"
causing severe acid rain and reducing surface temperatures. One
likely genetic factor in extinction as population size decreases is
inbreeding depression. See puncruarep EQUILIBRIUM.

EYE MUSCLES 202

 

"The basic unit of the arthropod compound eye is the ommatidium,"
"comprising a cornea lens, crystalline cone, a group of usually 7-8"
sense (retinula) cells radially arranged around a central rhabdome
formed from their innermost fibrillar surfaces (rhabdomeres
"composed of microvilli), in which the light-sensitive pigment is"
"located, each rhabdome extending into a nerve fibre distally."

Higher molluscan (Le. cephalopod) eyes (e.g. of Octopus) tesemble
"those of vertebrates in complexity (see convercence); however,"
there is an ommatidium-like organization in the retina. For details of
"the vertebrate eye, see diagram and entries for structures labelled. See"
also TAPETUM.

Eye musc.es. (a) Extrinsic (outside eyeball). In vertebrates six such
"muscles rotate the eyeball: a pair of anterior oblique and four, more"

Fat (NeuTRAL Fat). Major form of LIP xm store in higher animals
and some plants. Commonly used synonymously with rareny CER-
"tp e, Which not only stores more energy per gram than any other cell"
"constituent (24 times the ATP yield of glycogen) but,. being hydro-"
"phobic, requires less water of hydration than polysaccharide and is"

therefore far less bulky per -gram to store. aprrosz rissuz 1S

"CH;(CH,),,COOH; unsaturated fatty acids include oleic acid,"
"CH, (CH,),CH: CH(CH,),COOH. See ratTy acip oxipaTIon,"

LIPASE.

"FATTY ACID OXIDATION (BETA-oxIDATION). Prior to oxidation, fatty"
acids undergo a complex activation in the cytosol followed by trans-
"port across the mitochondrial membranes, whereupon the acyl group"
binds to COENZ Y ME A to form a fatty acyl-CoA thioester. The
terminal two carbon atoms are removed enzymatically (forming

"acetyl CoA, for entry. into the KREBS c Yc LE) while- another CoA --"
molecule is bound to the remaining fatty acid chatn. Each sequential
2-carbon temoval is accompanied by dehydrogena tion and production
of reduced NAD for entry into the ELECTRON TRANSPORT SYS-
TEM of mitochondria and ATP production. See wramm ec.

FeatueR. Elaborate and specialized epidermal production character-
"istic of birds as a class, providing thermal insulation, colouration and,"

"_ generally, lift and thrust of wings during flight. Develops from feather"
"germ, a minute projection from the skin, within which longitudinal"
ridges of epidermal cells (barb ridges) form early on. On each ridge
further cells of appropriate shape and position form the barbules after
"keratinization, some cell processes becoming barbieels, or hooks. A deep"
"pit in the epidermis, the feather follicle, surrounds the bases of feathers."
"The first feathers are downfeathers in which the quill is very short, a ring"
of barbs with minute and non-interlocking barbules sticking up fromits
top edge giving a soft and fluffy texture. Some follicles produce down
"feathers throughout life, but most are pushed out by new feathers during"
"moulting. The adult (contour) feathers grow in definite tracts on theskin,"
with (except in penguins and RATITES) bare patches between.

"_ Other feather types include: intermediate feathers, showing a com-"
bination of features of contour and down feathers; filoplumes (plum-
"ulae), which are hair-like, usually lacking vanes; vibrissae, stiff and"
"bristle-like, often around the nares, and powder down, which is soft"
downy material giving off dusty particles used in feather cleaning.

The amount of keratin required to make a new set of contour
feathers may cause the timing of moulting to be under strong selection
pressure. Feathers may be pigmented or have a barbule arrangement
which produces interference colours. See Fig. 18.

"Fera. Of domesticated animals, living in a wild state. See escape."

Fermentation. Enzymatic and anaerobic breakdown of organic
"substances (typically sugars, fats)'by microorganisms to yield simpler"
organic products. Pasteur showed in about 1860 that microorganisms
were responsible (contrary to view of Liebig). Kuhne called the
"‘active principle’ an enzymz in 1878, and Buchner first isolated a"
fermentative cell-free yeast extract in 1897.

; The term is often used synonymously with anaerobic resprr a «

"aton. Classic examples include alcohol production by yeasts, and the ”"
conversion of alcohol to ‘ vinegar (acetic acid) by the bacterium
"Acetobucter aceti, a process commonly called acetification. Lactic"

FERTILIZATION (SYNGAMY). Fusion of two camerzs (which may be
nucleated cells or simply nuclei) to form a single cell (zygote) or
fusion nucleus. Commonly involves cytoplasmic coalescence (plas-
mogamy) and pooling of nuclear material (karyogamy). Withhu 2 1 os 1s
"it forms a fundamental feature of most eukaryotic sexual cycles, and"
in general the gametes that fuse are HAPLOID. When both are
"motile, as primitively in plants, fertilization isisogamous,; when they"
differ in size but are similar in form it 1s anisogamous; when one is
non-motile (and usually larger) it is termed oegamous. This is the
"typical mode in most plants, animals and many fungi. In many"
"gymnophytes and all anthophytes neither gamete is flagellated, and"
"apo u ten tose 1S involved in the fertilization process, In animals,"
external fertilization occurs (typically in aquatic forms) where gametes
"are shed outside the body prior to fertilization, internal fertilization"
occurs (typically as an adaptation to terrestrial life) where sperm are
"introduced into the female’s reproductive tract, where fertilization"
then occurs. After fertilization the egg forms a fertilization membrane
to preclude further sperm entry. Sometimes the sperm is required
"merely to activate the egg(see acrivarron, PARTHENOGENESIS,"

encodes an efficient mechanism for getting itself transferred from cell
"to cell, like many drug-resistance plasmids. Rarely, the F plasmid"
"integrates into the host chromosome (forming an Hfr cell), when the"
same transmission mechanism results in a segment of chromosome
adjacent to the integrated F plasmid being transferred from donor cell
"to recipient. In this condition it behaves very like a 4 propuacez,"
replicating only when the host chromosome does. When this cell
"conjugates with a cell lacking an F particle, a copy of the Afr"
"chromosome passes along the conjugation canal, the F particle enter"

ITNEss (SELEcTIvVE value). Factor describing the difference in
reproductive success of an individual or genotype relative to another.
Usually symbolized by w. Often regarded as compound of survival
(longevity)-and annual fecundity.

"(1) Of individuals. Lifetime reproductive success, either ‘lifetime re-"
"productive output’ (the lifetime fecundity), or the number of offspring"
teaching reproductive age. Both omit information on the reproductive
"output of these offspring, and hence on the number of grandchildren"
"reaching reproductive age, or the number of great grandchildren"
"doing so, and so on. Fecundity alone is therefore only one component"
of fitness: an individual may leave more descendants in the long term
by producing fewer total offspring but by ensuring a greater proba-
bility of their survival to reproductive age (eg. by provisioning fewer
"seeds with more food reserves). Likewise, natural selection will favour"
any heritable factor that improves the chances of a gene’s representa-

tion in subsequent* generations. Thus an individual may promote
"future representation of its own genes, even if it leaves no offspring"
"itself, by contributing to the fitness of close relatives. Any actions"
"which do so contribute improve an agent’s inclusive fitness, calculated"
from that individual’s reproductive success plus its effects upon the
"reproductive success of its relatives, each effect weighted by the"
"relative’ coefficient of RELATED ness to the agent. Likewise, an"
individual’s fitness may be improved by the effects of its relatives.
"See HELPER, UNIT OF SELECTION."

"(2) Ofgenotypes. Usually applied to a single locus, where the fitness"
"value, w, of a genotype such as Aa is defined as | ~s, where s is the"
selection coefficient against the genotype. The existence of fitness
differences between genotypes creates selection for the evolution of

"usually green, leaftlike, and enclosing and protecting the other flower"
"parts while in the bud stage. Within the sepals are petals (the corolla,"
"collectively), usually conspicuous and brightly coloured. Calyx and"
corolla together constitute the perianth. They are not directly con-

Foon cuain. A metaphorical chain of organisms,. existing in any
natural cominunity, through which energy and matter aré transferred.
Each link in the chain feeds on, and hence obtains energy from, the
one preceding it aiid isin tum eaten by and provide: energy for ‘the‘one
succeeding it. Number of links in the chain is commonly three or four,
and seldom exceeds gx, At the beginning of the chain are giéen_ plants
(autotrophs). Those organisms whose food is obtained from ‘green
plants through the same number of links are described as belonging to
_the same TRO PHI Cie v « L. Thus green plants occupy one level (T?),
the PRODUCER level. All other levels are ‘CONSUMER levels: “T?
(her&ores, or primary consumers); T? and T¢ (secoridary consumers:
the smaller and larger carnivores respectively). At each trophic level,
much of the energy (and catbon atoms) are lost by respiration and so
less biomass can be supported ; at the next level. Bacteria, fungi and
some *protozoa are consumers that function in decomposition of all
levels (see DECOMPOSER), All the food chains in 4 community of
organisms make up the FOOD WEB. See PYRAMID OF BIOMASS.

Foop vacuote. Vacuole, usually enclosing potential food objects,
produced during ENDOCYTOSIS by ‘phagocytic cells. Temporary,
‘normally becoming a heterophagosome (see LYSOSOME).

Foon wes. The totality of interacting FOOD CHAINS within a com-
munitj qf organisms. See Ecosystem,

FoRAMEN. Natural opening (e.g. FORAMEN macnum of skull,
F 0 Ra men Ov a LE of foetal heart). Foramina in bones permit nerves
and blood vessels to enter and leave.

FORAMEN MAGNUM. Opening at back of vertebrate skull, at articula-
tion with vertebral column, through-which spinal cord _passes. aa
 

FORAMEN OVALE 216

 

FORAMEN ovate. Opening between left and right atria of hearts of
foetal mammals, normally closing at birth (failure to do so resulting
in ‘hole’ in the heart). While open, it permits much of the oxygenated
blood returning to the foetal heart from the placenta to pass across
to the left atrium, thus bypassing the pulmonary circuit (which in the
absence of functional lungs is largely occluded). From there blood
passes via the left ventricle to the foetal body.

FoRAMINIFERA. Order of mainly marine protozoans whose shells form
an important component of chalk and of many deep sea oozes (e.g.
Globigerina ooze). Shells may be calcareous, siliceous, or composed
of foreign particles. Thread-like pseudopodia protrude through pores
in the shell and may or may not exhibit cytoplasmic streaming. See
HELIOZOA, RADIOLARIA.

FOREBRAIN (PROSENCEPHALON). Most anterior of the three expansions
of the embryonic vertebrate brain. Gives rise to diencephalon (thala-
mus and hypothalamus) and telencephalon (cerebral hemispheres).
Also the origin of the eyestalks. Associated originally with olfaction.

Category within species, generally applied to members showing — trivial
variations from type, e.g. in colour of the corolla. SeeIn FRA s P EC IF'Ic
var I ATION. (Zool.) Used more or less synonymously with morph,
. to indicate one of the forms within a dimorphic or polymorphic
species population.

Formation. See Brome.

Fossi. Remains of an organism, or direct evidence of its presence,
preserved in rock, ice, amber, tar, peat or volcanic ash, Animal hard
parts (hard skeletons) commonly undergo mineralization, a process
which also tums sediment into hard rock (both regarded as diagene-
sis). The aragonite (a form of CaCO,) of molluscs and gastropods
may recrystallize as the common alternative form, calcite; or it may
dissolve to leave a void. This mould may then be filled later by
replacement, involving precipitation of another mineral (possibly
calcite or silica). Partial replacement and impregnation of the onginal
hard parts in both plants and animals by mineral salts (permineraliza-
tion) may occur, especially if the material is porous— as are wood
and , bone. Fossils may occur in situ, or else (derived fossils) be
released by erosion of the rock and subsequent, reposition in new
sediments. Sometimes, the fossil imprints of different locomotory
styles (gaits) of the same individual animal are given different taxono-
mic names. Fossils may be dated by various methods, and provide
direct evidence for EVOL u TION, as well as telling us about past
conditions on Earth. See czorocrca. pzrrons. For fossils of
mankind’s ancestors, see HO MI NTI D.

FOUNDER errect. Effects on a population’s subsequent evolution
‘attributable to the fact that founder individuals of the colonizing
population have only a small and probably non-representative sample
of the parent population’s cenz poor. Subsequent evolution
may take a different course from that in the parent population as a
result of this limited genetic variation. Likely to occur where coloniza-
tion is a rare event, as on oceanic islands, and where the colonizer is
not noted for mobility. May be combined with effects of cEyerze

FUCOXANTHIN. Carotenoid pigment present with chlorophyll in
various algal groups; e.g. PHAE'OPHYTA, CHRYSOPHYTA, PRYM-
NESIOPHYTA, BACILLARIOPHYTA.

Function. In one sense, the function of a component in an organism
is the contribution it makes to that organism’s Frmess. Therefore it
may also be the ultimate reason for that component’s existence in the

‘organism, having been selected for in previous generations.. This
does not exclude: the possibility that a component may arise by
mutation in an individual and have immediate selective value (and
hence function) in that individual; but its function would not then be

the reason for its existence in‘that individual. See rzetzotoey .

Funai. Kingdom containing those eukaryotes lacking chlorophyll
(being either saprotrophs, parasites or symbionts), with either an
acellular (commonly coenocytic) or a relatively simple tissue-like
organization; organizational unit is the Aypha (matted to form a
mycelium), and the most complex structures ,are reproductive bodies
involved in spore production. Considered to deserve kingdom _ status
on account of: chitinous wall material; a basically a cen 1 ut aR
organization usually involving vacuolated hyphae rather than distinct
cells; storage of oil and glycogen (butnot starch); some very compli-
cated parasitic life cycles involving several spore types, and some
peculiar genetic mechanisms (see c LAM PCO NNEC TION, CROZIR

GameTte (Germ cet). Haploid cell (sometimes nucleus) specialized
for rerrturzatton. Gametes which so fuse may be identical in
form and size (isogamous) or may differ in one or both properties
(anisogamous). The terms ‘male’ and ‘female’ are often applied to
gametes, but serve only to indicate the sex of origin, for gametes do
not have sexes. Where they differ in size it is customary to refer to
the larger gamete as the macrogamete, and to the smaller as the
microgamete. Sometimes plasmogamy is absent in fertilization, in
which case the nuclei which fuse may be regarded as gametes. See

‘decision making’ by living systems (usually lacking conscious —_over-
tones) in which an organism’s responses to its conditions are
viewed as strategies whose (evolutionary) goal is maximization of the
organism’s rrr ness. Often convenient to regard each organism as
having at any time a decision procedure for responding to future
circumstances in such a way as to maximize any possible pay-off to
itself while minimizing the pay-offs to others (but see 1 N c Lou g] ve

GAP GENES 222

 

Outer layer is hard inorganic enamel-like ganoine, thicker than in
otherwise similar COSMQID scazz. Grows in thickness by addition
of material both above (ganoine) and below (laminated bone). Found
today in eg. Polypterus, Lepisosteus and sturgeons.

Gap: cenes. A class of Drosophila segmentation genes, mutants of
which delete several adjacent segments and create gaps in the antero-
posterior pattern. They are the first zygotic genes to be expressed in
Drosophila development. Some genes -in the class, such as Kriippel
(Kr), hunchback (hb) and knirps (kni), encode proteins with DN A-
binding - |» ce rv Om az» 3 Whose regulation is exerted at the trans-
criptional’level (see BICOID cenz, osxar cenz). The patterns of
their expression determine those of pazr-runz canes, which in
turn determine those of szemenr-ponarrry cznzs although
mutual interactions complicate this picture. The Drosophila gap gene
knirps encodes a hormone receptor-like protein of the steroid-thyroid
superfamily essential for abdominal segmentation, similar to ligand-
dependent DNA-binding proteins of vertebrates (see re CE P To R
e ROTEL xs). The Krippe/ ptoduct (K,) and hb product (Hb) bind to
different DNA sequences upstream of the two hb promotors.

dorsally from anteror part-of gut in most of the acTINOPTERYGII.
In fullest development (in ACANTHO PTER x Git) acts as hydrostatic
organ; but, may also act. as an accessory organ of gaseous. exchange,
as a sound producer, or as a resonator in sound reception. Opinions
differ as to whether the gas bladder or the vertebrate lung is the
ancestral structure; they are certainly homologous.

Gastric. Of the- stomach. Gastric juice is a product, of vertebrate
gastric glands, and contains hydrochloric acid, proteolytic enzymes
and mucus. '

Gastain. Hormone secreted by mammalian stomach and duodenal
mucosae in response to proteins and alcohol. Stimulates gastric
glands of stomach to secrete large amounts of gastric juice. Relaxes
pyloric sphincter and closes cardiac sphincter. Oversecretion may
‘result.in gastric ulcers. See SECRETIN, CHOLECYSTOKININ.

Gastropopa. Large class of the monnusca. Marine, freshwater
and terrestrial. Head distinct, with eyes and tentacles, well-developed,
rasping tongue (raddla). Foot large and muscular, used in locomo-
tion. Visceral hump coiled, and rotated on the rest of body (torsion)
so that the anus in the mantle cavity points forward; some forms
undergo a secondary detorsion. Visceral hump commonly covered by
a single (untvalve) shell. Often a trochosphere larva. Includes subclas-

-Pulmonata (e.g. snails; slugs). :

GastrotricHa Class of the ascueumwrazs (or a phylum in its
own right), probably closely related to nematode worms. Composed

GASTRULA. Stage of embryonic development in animals, succeeding
stastura, When the primary czrm .avers are laid down as a
result of the morphogenetic processes of GA st Ru LA T IO N.

GASTRULATION. Phase of embryonic development in animals during
which the primary cs 2 k wt Aye R §are laid down; its onset is character-
ized by the morphogenetic movements of cells, typically through the

BLASTOPORE, forming the ARCHENTERON. Movementsmay result
in zpr sory, but frequently also emboly in which cells invaginate,
involute and ingress.

Gas vacuote. Structure comprising gas vesicles, or hollow cylindrical

. tubes with conical ends, found in the cytoplasm of all orders of
CYAn Op a Creer a (blue-green algae) except Chamaesiophonales. A
“gas vesicle comprises protein ribs or spirals arranged like hoops of a
barrel. Gas vacuoles may function in light shielding and/or buoy-
ancy.

GATED CHANNELS. TRANSPORT PRoTEIns Of membranes, not con-
stitutively (permanently) open to the passage of molecules, but cap-
able of closure. Ligand-gated channels, such as those responding to
NEUROTRANSMITTERS, Open only in response to an extracellular
ligand; voltage-gated channels (e.g. the sop 1U m pume of nerve and
muscle fibres) are dependent for opening and closure upon an ap-
propriate membrane potential. Others may only open when  concentra-
tions of certain ions in the cell are appropriate. See IM PU use,

gemmae-cups.
 

 

GEMMATION 224

 

Gemmation. Asexual reproduction involving formation of a group
of cells (@ GEMMA in plants) which develops into a new individual, or
anew member of a colony of connected individuals. May develop
before its complete or partial separation from the parent. Occurs in
many bryophytes, coelenterates and ascidians. Referred to as budding
in animals.

GeEMMULE. ‘(1} Of sponges, a bud formed internally as a group of
cells, which may become free by decay of the parent and subsequently
form a new individual. Freshwater sponges over-winter in this way.

"Gene. Usually regarded as the smallest physical ,unit of heredity"
encoding a molecular cell product; commonly considered also to be a
ontr Or SELECTION. The term gene (coined by W. Johannsen in
1909) may be used in more than one sense. These include: a)
"ALLELE, b) wocus, and c) CiSTRON. What ewnex treated as‘"
algebraic units (‘factors’) or ‘atoms of heredity’ obeyed his laws of
inheritance ‘and were considered to be the physical determinants °
of discrete phenotypic characters. This may be called the classical gene
"concept (see:GENETICS). In 1903, W. S. Sutton pointed out that"
the segregation and recombination of Mendelian factors studied in

. heredity found a parallel in the behaviour of chromosomes revealed
by the microscope. Through the work of T. H. Morgan in the
"period 19] O-20, chromosomes came to be regarded as groups of"
"linked genes (or, more abstractly, of their loci), and the positions"
of loci and their representative alleles were first mapped on the
"chromosomes of Drosophila in this period. Morgan found, that"
alternative genes (alleles) at a locus could mutate from one to an-
other.

The importance of genes in enzyme production first emerged through
"work on the chemistry and inheritance of eye colour in Drosophila,"
and through work on AUXOTROPHIC mutants of the mould Neuro-
spora crassa by G. W. Beadle and E. L. Tatum (1941). It heralded the
modem phase of genetics and molecular biology.

Genes soon became accepted as the heritable determinants of
"enzymes (one , gene : one enzyme) However, the comespondence be-"
tween the nucleotide composition of a gene and the ammo acid
composition of its encoded product was first revealed in variants of
"haemoglobin (a non-enzymic protein) and its genes, and their precise"
sequential correspondence (colinearity) was* first established. in
detailed studies of the bacterial enzyme fryptophan synthetase and its
gene. Great precision was by now being achieved in fine genetic
mapping of BACTERIOPHAGE chromosomes using the c1s-TRANS
"vest, and genes were soon regarded as nucleic acid sequences,"

bactenum £. coli showed that two genes were required to encode this

“gene’ is used to indicate the length of nucleic acid encoding any
"molecular cell product; be it a polypeptide, transfer RNA or ribo-"
"‘somal RN A molecule, and can usually be equated with ¢ IS rro n"

GENE AMPLIFICATION. Process in | which a small region of the

remains unreplicated. Occurs in some specialized cell lines where
large quantities of a particular cell product are needed rapidly. In
"rRN A cistrons, up to 1000 extra nucleoli may arise in amphibian"
"oocytes in this way, with consequent large-scale ribosome production."
Cistrons for rR NA are amplified in all cells with nucleoli. Gene
amplification is associated with some kinds of dry resistance in cell
cultures; amplication of cellular ON co G ENES is a fairly common
feature of tumour cells. The whole phenomenon of selective DNA

cell (e.g. E. coli) for copying.

"Gene conversion. Phenomenon, in eukaryotes occurring mainly"
"at synapsis during meiosis, whereby a donor DNA sequence, a few"
"hundred bases or perhaps a kilobase in length, is transferred from"
one gene to another having substantial ‘sequence homology (usually
"between homologous loci, but sometimes between related sequences"
"at non-homologous” loci, notably those of dispersed munrze 2 wz"
ra M1 ws). The donor sequence is repaired back to its onginal form.
It may be responsible for much of the diversity in some mammalian
immunogobulin production (see awrrsopy opiverstry). In one
model this involves ‘nicking’ (cutting) of a single-strand invading
DNA sequence and melting (unzipping) of the invaded duplex D N A
so that heteroduplex base pairing- between the’ two--can occur. The
ousted sequence is enzymatically degraded while the invading se-
quence is cut and then annealed into its new position. Its original

complementary strand is then used as template for its resynthesis to

"form the original duplex again. In another model, increasingly"
"favoured, the recipient DNA duplex is nicked and gapped in both"
"strands, the gap being filled by copy-synthesis using both strands of"
the donor duplex as templates. This would generate heteroduplexes

only in regions flanking the gap. In a heterozygote of the yeast °
Saccharomyces; where conversion occurs at a rate of several per cent
"per gene per meiosis, each allele can usually convert the other with"
"about equal frequency, but examples of strongly biassed conversion"

"are known which could, in principle, lead to fixation of the favoured"
allele.

"Initiation of the cutting, and hence of the recombination,seems in"
"one form of the,process to occur within a gene promoter region. There"
is growing support for the view that the sites of heteroduplex formation

. (Holliday junctions) are responsible for much of eukaryotic crossing-
over: there is about 30 ~ 50% association of gene conversion-with
crossing-over. Gene conversion in prokaryotes involves similar proces-
"ses, although the initial alignment of homologous duplexes is less"
"highly organized (see reca, recB and récC), See reCoMsrnarzon."

Gene pupuication. Mechanisms resulting in tandem duplication of
loci along a chromosome. One of the possible evolutionary conse-
quences of diploidy as opposed- to haploidy is that with two functional
representatives of a locus per cell it may not matter if one mutates
and loses its original function. This is very likely also the evolutionary
significance of gene duplication: one copy is fee to mutate and take
"on a new function, the other functioning as normal. The enzymes of"
the glycolytic pathway may have arisen this way from a common
"ancestral gene sequence, as most certainly do the various types of"
globin in haemoglobin. Non-homologous crosstne-over is one
mechanism for producing gene duplication. See mor 7 IGEN =

GENE EXPRESSION/GENE eGuLATION. The effect of those mech-

transcribed (acts as a template for mR N A synthesis) at any particular
time. In prokaryotes it may best be explained by some variant of the
JacoB—Monop THEORY; in eukaryotes too this theory may
"find application, although different C H R 0 M OSO ME structure here"
raises fresh problems. It is common in eukaryotes to recognize two
classes of regulatory phenomena involving gene expression: short-
"term (reversible) regulation, and long-term (often irreversible) —_regula-"
tion. Short-term regulation often relates to a cell’s production of

GENE MANIPULATION (GENETIC ENGINEERING). Set of procedures by
which selected pieces (genes) of one genome (e.g. human) can be
"enzymatically cut out from it, spliced into a vector (eg. a PLASMI p)"
"and inserted into an appropriate host microorganism (e.g. E. coli,"

of the microorganism forming a clone. Various enzymes used include

triplets run from the Y-end to the 3’-end of the rRNA. The three nucleotides
"for any trip/et are found by taking one from the left column, one from the"
horizontal row and one from the right column. The amino acid indicated at
their intersection is that encoded by that triplet. Thus CGC encodes proline.
Three stop codons ae also indicated. ‘

amino acids in a polypeptide correspond to the letters of an alphabet
rather than to words. Since more than one triplet may encode some

transfer RNA molecules for particular amino acids = itself the result
of specificity of the enzymes which activate amino acids and bind
them to appropriate tRNAs.

types. The sreepinc system of the population is an important
"consideration, affecting the relative levels of free and potential vari-"
ability. Free variability is genetic variation which is expressed pheno-
typically and approximates to the proportion of homozygotes in
the population; potential variability is genetic variation which does
not express itself phenotypically and approximates to the proportion
of heterozygotes in the population.

"However, two or more loci often affect the same character (pol ge-"
"nic inheritance), and in the simplest case (where both loci are additive"
with respect to effect on phenotype) may generate the same pheno-
"types in the double heterozygote, GgHh, as in both the double"
"homozygotes, GGhh and .ggHH, thus ‘protecting’ the latter-from"
"selection, even though their homozygous potential variation con-"
tributes to the total potential variation in the population. Alleles
always exert their effects against a “genetic background’ which can
modify their — expressions.

"Only through crossing, with its subsequent segregation, can a"
major part of the potential variability in a population be freed and
"become available for selection. Inbred populations, comprising all"
"possible types of homozygotes, will harbour almost as much po-"

"species, and can promote fruit development (e.g. almonds: peaches,"
"grapes). In barley and other grass seeds, the embryo releases"
gibberellins causing the aleurone layer of the endosperm to produce
"enzymes (e.g. cc-amylase), digesting the starch store to mobilize sugars"
for germination. The gibberellin causes expression of the gene
"encoding the amylase (ie. de-repression), the mechanism resembling"
that by which zc> ¥ SONE exerts its effects. Some commercial plant
growth retardants achieve their results by blocking gibberellin
synthesis.

"Git. (Bot.) See LAMELLA, cruz runer. (Zool.) Any of several"
"organs of gaseous exchange in aquatic animals, such as the vascu-"
larized projections of the external surface (external gills) of many
annelids and arthropods. Parapodia of polychaetes and. thin-walled
trunk limbs of branchiopod crustaceans increase the surface area for
diffusion of dissolved gases and probably function as gills; but in
"some tracheal gills of insect larvae and-pupae, these leaf-like projec-"
"tions, despite their rich supply of trachea& (though lacking open"
"spiracles), absorb less oxygen than the remaining body surface."
Spiracular gills occur in some aquatic insect pupae where one or
more pairs of spiracles is drawn out into long processes and generally
supplied with a pzasrron. Vertebrate gills are either external .
(ectodermal) or internal (endodermal). The former occur in larvae
"of a few bony fish (Polypterus and some lungfish) and of amphibians,"
and are almost always soon lost or replaced by internal gills. Fish
gills may serve as organs of OSMOREGULATION. See VENTILA-
TION and Fig. 23.

GLycotysis. Anaerobic degradation of glucose (usually in the form
"of glucose-phosphate) to yield pyruvate, forming initial process by"
"which glucose is fed into aerobic phase of resprrarzon, Which"
usually occurs in MITOCHONDRIA. Cells without mitochondria (and
those prokaryotes without a mesosomz) rely on glycolysis for most
"of their AT P synthesis, as do facultatively anaerobic cells (e.g. striated"
muscle fibres) when there is a shortage of-oxygen. The pathway is
illustrated in Fig. 27. It generates a net gain of two molecules of ATP

Perhaps the most significant step in glycolysis is hydrolysis oy each
"fructose 1,6-bisphosphate molecule into two triose phosphate mole-"
"cules, the remaining steps in the pathway thereby effectively occurring"
twice for every initial glucose-phosphate molecule used. Conversion
"of fructoset+-phosphate to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate is the main"
"rate-limiting step in glycolysis, and phosphofructokinase, the enzyme"
"involved, is a recunatory ewzymz, modulated by the ratio in the"
levels of (A M P + A DP): A T P in the cytosol so that high ATP
levels inhibit glycolysis. Enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway

GRAMICIDIN. See tonopuore.

GRAM’S stain. Stain devised by C. Gram in 1884 which differentiates
. between bacteria which may be otherwise similar morphologically.
Toa heat-fixed smear containing the bacteria is added crystal violet
solution for 30 s which is then rinsed off with Gram’s iodine solution;
95% ethanol is applied and renewed until most of the dye has. been
removed (20 s = 1 min). Those bacteria, with the stain retained are
Gram-positive, those without are Gram-negative. A counterstain (e.g.
eosin red,, saffranin, brilliant green) is then applied, colouring the
Gram-negative bacteria but not the Gram-positive ones. Differentiation
teflects differences in amount and ease of access of peptidoglycan in
the bacterial envelope. Gram-negative bacteria have a second lipo-
protein membrane outside the thin peptidoglycan layer covering the
inner (cytoplasmic) membrane. Gram-positive bacteria lack this outer
membrane, but have a thicker peptidoglycan coat. Among other
differences, Gram-positive bacteria are more susceptible to penicillin,

whom it was a scale of degradation, from man at the top): that there
is a linear and hierarchical progression of forms of existence, from
simplest to most complex, lacking both gaps and marked transitions.

GreenHouse EFFECT. Effect in which short wavelength solar radia-
tion entering the Earth’s atmosphere is reradiated from the Earth’s
surface in the longer infrared wavelengths and is then reabsorbed by
components of the atmosphere to become an important factor in
heating the total atmosphere. Oxygen, ozone, carbon dioxide. and
water vapour all absorb in the infrared wavelengths, and increasing
amounts of carbon dioxide from combustion of fossil fuels is a
growing factor in raising the mean atmospheric temperature. Effect
resembles heat reflection by greenhouse glass.

Grey matter. Tissue of vertebrate spinal cord and brain containing
numerous cell bodies and dendrites of neurones, along with unmayelin-
ated neurones synapsing with them, glial cells and blood vessels.
Occurs as inner region of nerve cord, around central canal; in brain

collagen and chondroitin sulphate in bone and cartilage; promotes
mitosis in osteoblasts and increase in girth and length of bone prior
to closure of zpzpuyses. Transported in plasma by a crosvzin
protein. Its release is prevented by hypothalamic SOMATOSTATIN.
"Induces release from liver of the hormone somatomenin, which"

growth rings. In early and middle summer new xylem vessels aye
"large and produce a pale wood, contrasting with the narrower and"
"denser vessels of late summer and autumn, which produce a dark"
wood. Width of these rings varies from year to year depending upon
"environmental conditions, such as availabilities of light, water and"
nutrients and temperature. Age of a tree may be estimated by
"counting the number of growth rings, and in semi-arid regions"
trees are sensitive rain gauges (eg. bristlecone pine Pinus longaeva).

Fig. 32. Mammalian heart showing direction of oxygenated (-* = >) and
"deoxygenated (—+) blood. ,"

basic S-shaped heart of most fish comprises four chambers pumping
blood unidirectionally forward to the gills. This single circulation has
the route:

body ~ heart -> gills > body.

Replacement of gills by lungs in tetrapods was associated with the
need for a heart providing a double circulation in order to keep
oxygenated blood (returning to the heart from the lungs) separate
from deoxygenated blood (returning to the heart from the body).
The blood route becomes:

body > heart > lungs > heart > body.

"In amphibians, two atria return blood from these two sources to a"
"single ventricle, and separation is limited, reptiles have a very complex"
ventricle with a septum assisting separation; birds and mammals
"have two atria and two ventricles, one side of the heart dealing with"
oxygenated and the other with deoxygenated blood (see He arr
"cyctz). In annelids, the whole dorsal aorta may be contractile with,"
"in addition, several vertical contractile vessels, or ‘hearts’. The insect"
heart is a long peristaltic tube lying in the roof of the abdomen and
265 HELPER.

 

perforated by paired segmental holes (ostia) through which blood
enters from the haemocoele. There may be accessory hearts in the
"thorax. Blood is driven forwards into the aorta, which opens into the"
haemocoele. A similar arrangement occurs in other arthropods. The
basic molluscan heart comprises a median ventricle and two atria.
See PERICARDIUM.

HEART cyYCLE (caRDIAc cycle). One complete sequence of contrac-
"tion and relaxation of heart chambers, and opening and closing of"
"valves, during which time the same volume of blood enters and leaves"
the heart. Chamber contraction (systole) is followed by its relaxation
(diastole) when it fills again with blood. In mammals and birds
ventricular diastole draws in most of the blood from the atria; atrial
systole adds only 30% to ventricular blood volume. The pa cE-
maxer and its associated fibres ensure that the two atria contract
simultaneously just prior to the two ventricles. Atrioventricular
valves open when atrial pressure exceeds ventricular and close when
ventricular pressure exceeds atrial: See carpro-acceLeratory

state if they are to spread. Theory has it that if a mutation is
"advantageous, selection will make its advantageous heterozygous"
"effects dominant and its deleterious effects recessive, thus giving"
heterozygotes a higher rrmzss than homozygotes. There are re-

their tendency to donate their phosphate group to water (to be
hydrolysed) as is indicated by their STANDARD Free enercres of
"hydrolysis (the more negative it is, the greater the tendency to be"
"hydrolysed). Phosphate- bond energy (not bond energy, the energy"
required to break a bond) indicates the difference between free
energies of reactants and products respectively before and after
hydrolysis of a phosphorylated compound.

Fig. 33 indicates tendencies for phosphate groups (shown by arrows)
to be transferred between commonly occurring phosphorylated com-
pounds of cells. High-energy phosphate bonds arise because of
-resonance hybridity between single and double bonds. of the phos-
"phorus/oxygen atoms, which renders them more stable (i.e. they"
have less free energy) than expected from structure alone. All common

which control the system would fail to function.

"(1) Physiological, Various processes which help regulate and  main-"
tain constancy of the internal environment of a cell or organism at

"to some effector when the value changes, which c)} restores the value"
"of the variable to normality, consequently shutting-off the original"

Hominio. Member of the primate family Hominidae (superfamily
"Hominoidea), including mankind, whose most distinctive attribute is"
"bipedalism = upright walking. Short face, small incisors and canines"
and tendency towards parabolic shape of dentary also characteristic.
Probably originated in Upper Miocene/Pliocene. Includes the au-
"STRALOPITHECINES, whose relationship with Homo requires more"
fossil material and analysis. Pre-molecular data suggest Ramapithecus
as the earliest fossil ape with hominid affinities so far discovered;
post-molecular data suggest a much more recent separation of the
"human lineage from the apes, at perhaps as little as 5 Myr BP. Some"
"would even place Aftican anthropoid apes (Pun, Gorilla) and humans"
"inthesameclade. See HOMO, PONGIDAE, RAMAPITHECUS ."

form from Africa and eastern Asia. Some neanderthal skulls had a
"cranial capacity in excess of the average of modern mai, albeit of"
somewhat different proportions. Their post-cranial skeletons overlap
"those of modern man in most morphological respects, but show an"
enhanced robustness and signs of adaptation to cold environments.
The precise origins of anatomically modern man prior to 40 Kyr BP

HOMOEOBOX (HOMEOBOX. Conserved protein-encoding DNA se-
"quence, first located in 1984 within several HOMOEOTIC gene se—"
"quences of Drosophila but since detected in the genomes of annelids,"
"molluscs, echinoderms and vertebrates. In many cases, homoeobox"
products in very distantly elated organisms share a high percentage
"of their amino acid sequences, and it tends to be these homoeodomains"
that have DNA-binding properties. These proteins tend therefore to
be localized within nuclei. Expression of some homoeobox sequences
may be instrumental in such developmental events as segmentation
and cell determination so that their expression is often highly  tissue-
specific. There is evidence that some encode rranscriPrion
FACTORS. See COMPARTMENT.

"HOMOEOTIC (HOMEOTIC). (1) Term describing a control gene which,"
by either being transcribed or remaining silent during development
(according to decisions between alternative pathways of pevEtor—
"M ENT), can profoundly affect the developmental fate of ‘a region of"
"a plant or animal’s body. As yet found only in insects, one nematode"

provide clones of cells with ‘genetic addresses’ for differentiation. In
"the insect wing IMAGINAL oprsc, such a decision sequence appears"
"to be: — anterior/posterior, dorsal/ventral, — proximal/distal. A — homoeotic"
mutation is a DNA sequence change comprehensively transforming
its own and its descendant cells’ morphologies into those of a different

"In Drosophila, examples include engrailed, antennapedia and _ bithorax."

 
   

 

 

 

HOMOGAMETIC SEX 278

 

Implications of homoeosis for uo mo Lo cy are controversial. Anten-
napedia mutants have all or parts of their antennae converted into leg
structures. Since antennae are regarded as the paired appendages of
"the second embryonic somite, their homology with and evolutionary"
development from paired ambulatory appendages receives some sup-
port from this source. The same applies to the segmentally-arranged
mouthparts.

(2) Of organs whose positions are altered as a result of homoeotic
"mutation. See COMPARTMENT, HOMOEOBOX, IMAGINAL DISC."

HomoGameTic sex. The sex producing gametes which are uniform

Homotoay. A controversial term. In evolutionary biology denotes
"common descent. Two or more structures, developmental processes,"
"D N A sequences, behaviours, etc. usually occurring in different taxa,"
‘are said to be homologous if there is good evidence that they are
"derivations from (or identical to) some common ancestral structure,"

"ous with the senposryrz of urochordates, etc. The term may be"
"applicable even when, as with the vertebrate PENTA DACTYL ne,"
comparablestructures do not always arise from the same embryonic
segment. Where structures are repeated along the organism with little
"or no modification, as occurs inmz 7 a mer t sm, they are termed"
serially homologous structures. Much evidence for homology 1s likely
to come from work on HOMOEOTIC mutants. See ANALOGOUS.

"[In paynocenerics, Of ciaprstics, two characters, etc., are"
homologous if .one (the apomorphic character) is derived directly
"from the other (the plesiomorphic character), The relationship is often"
termed special homology. Some workers in cladistics equate hom-

Hormone. Term once applied in both botanical and zoological
"contexts, but now restricted to the latter (see GrowrH suBSrancz) ."
"Denotes any molecule, usually of small molecular mass, secreted"
directly into the blood by ductless glands and carried to specific

adaptive physiological response. The term -chemical messenger 1s
"Still Sometimes used in this context, s—E co ND MESSENGERS being"
"molecular signals produced within, but not exported by, a cell."
Neurotransmitters and neurosecretions customarily fall outside the
"compass of the term hormone, a distinction blurred by » EURO-"
uazmaL orcans. Hormones tend to be either water-soluble
"peptides and proteins, or steroids. The latter have the longer physio-"

discovery of chromosomal mutational ‘hot-spots’ housing extra
"DNA implicated chromosomal insertions, and transposable elements"
are now known to be responsible. These H D insertions are integrated
"into wild stock genomes, encoding repressor molecules which inhibit"
transposition and hence mutagenesis. Repressor concentration would
"thus be high in wild eggs, preventing transposition of elements"

IpentiFication keys. Keys used in discovering the name of a specimen
are commonly constructed so as to lead the investigator through a
sequence of choices between mutually exclusive character descrip-

entiate largely into adult epidermal structures: eyes and antennae
"from one pair, front legs from another pair; wings and halteres from"
"two more pairs; genitals from a midline unpaired disc, and so on."
Most discs are vevermrnen in the larval insect and remain so
through artificial subculture; but transdetermination of cells may
occur. Much remains to be learnt of the evolution of this mode of
development. Cues for differentiation of discs into adult tissues are
apparently hormonal; but the origin of the determined state appears
"to depend upon POSITIONAL inrormarion, expressed as genetic"

IMaGo. Sexually mature adult insect.

"ImsiBitTion. Tendency of co:oms, and substances forming col-"
"loidal gels, to adsorb water passively (colloidal imbibition); often"
"responsible for swelling of organs, such as seeds during germination."

"ImBricate, (Of leaves, petals, etc.) closely overlapping."

IMMUNE TOLERANCE (IMMUNOLOGICAL ToLeraNce). Acquired inability
fo react to particular self- or non-self-antigens. Both e » caus and: -
"cexzs display tolerance, generally to their specific antigen classes."
The concentration of antigen required to induce tolerance in neonatal
B-cells is 100-fold less than for adult B-cells. Responsible for sup-
pression of transplant rejection. First noticed in non-identical twin
cattle which shared foetal circulations (i.e. were synchorial). See
"THYMUS .,"

Immunity. Ability of animal or plant to resist infection by parasites
and effects of other harmful agents. Essential requirement for sur-
"vival, since most of these organisms are perpetually menaced by"
"viruses, bacteria and fungi, or parasitic animals."

In animals there are two functional divisions of the immune system:
innate (non-specific) immunity and adaptive (specifically acquired)
immunity. The former includes physical and chemical barriers to
"entry of pathogens (e.g. lysozyme, mucus, intact skin/cuticle, sebum,"
"colony-stimulating factors, stomach acid, ciliary respiratory lining,"
"commensal gut competitors, non-lymphocytic leucocytes of the"
RETICULO-ENDOTHELIAL system and neutrophils. Adaptive
"immune responses, unlike innate immune responses, differ in quality"
and/or quantity of response on repeated exposure to antigen: the
primary response to antigen takes longer to achieve significant an-
tibody titre than does the secondary response. They include active
"natural immunity, in Which the animal’s mzmory ceLn s respond to"
a secondary natural contact with antigen by multiplication and
"specific antibody release; and active induced immunity, in which a"
vacclN g (se also 1NO0 cu LAT Io N) initially sensitizes memory cells.
"Passive immunity may be either natural, as by acquisition of anti-"
"bodies via the placenta or colostrum in mammals, or induced, usually"
via specific antibodies injected intravenously. There is sometimes a
distinction made between cell-mediated (lymphocytic and —_ phagocytic)
"responses and humoral (antibody) responses in immunity, but it is"
never clear-cut: cells are involved in initiation of antibody responses
and cell-mediated responses are unlikely in the complete absence of
antibody. Cell-mediated immunity tends nowadays to refer to any
immune response in which antibodies play a relatively minor role.
"For distinctions between primary and secondary immune responses,"
"see B- CELL. See ANTIGEN- PRESENTING CELL, T- CELL, INFLAM-"

IMMUNIZATION 290

 

"surface preventing wetting and consequent development of pathogens,"
t-hick cuticles preventing entry of germ-tubes of fungal spores; or
"immunity may be protoplasmic’, the protoplast being an unfavourable"
environment for further development of the pathogen (see ruy TO-
atexins); Or it might be acquired immunity (in context of viral
"diseases) when the plant recovers from an acute disease, or when"

resistance to virulent strains is conferred by presence of avirulent
"ones. In the latter (non-sterile) cases, active virus persists in the"

recovered or protected plant. Freedom from a second attack of an

"acute disease, or protection from the effects of virulent strains,"
persists only as long as the plants are infected. Plants are not known

to produce antibodies.

IMMUNIZATION. Process rendering an animal less susceptible to infec-

"tion by pathogens, to toxins, etc. May involve use of VACC1 ne, or"

passive wm U nw 7 ty through injection. of appropriate antibodies. See

"protein with antibody activity. See Ig, IgD, IgE, IgG, IgM."

IMMUNOLOGICAL MEMORY. Sc@ B-ceELL. MEMORY CELLS.

IMPLANTATION (NIDATION). Attachment of mammalian  piastocystr
"to wall of uterus (endometrium) prior to further development, placenta"
"formation, etc. In humans the blastocyst is small and penetrates the"
"endometrium, passing into the subepithelial connective tissue —_(inter-"
stitial implantation). This involves breaking of JUN CTI ON AL COM-
"P LEXES between endometrial cells, and proteolytic eniymes may be"
secreted by the TROPHOBLAST to achieve this.

"IMPRINTING. (1) Form of LEARNING, often restricted to a _ specific"
"sensitive period of an animal’s development, when a complex stimulus"
may appear to elicit no marked response at the time of reception but
nonetheless comes to form a model whose. later -presentation (or
something appropriately similar) elicits a highly significant response.
Particularly prevalent in birds. Filial imprinting involves narrowing of
"preferences in social companion (e.g. to mother, or to artificial"
"object, in ducklings), sexual imprinting involves the preferential direct-"
ing of sexual behaviour towards individuals similar to those encoun-
tered early in life. (2) See cenomic IMPRINTING.

Fig. 35. The action potential curve (Y resulting from changes in sodium
"and potassium conductances (®Na, ‘K) across an axon membrane ata"

Imputse. AN att—or-NoNE RESPONSE comprising an acrion PQ-
max ot a t propagated along the plasmalemma of:an excitable tissue
"cell, such as a nerve axon (between NO ves of ran vier in myelin-"
ated axons) or muscle fibre. Impulses are initiated at synapses by
depolarizations of the postsynaptic membrane’s resting potential
"(usually internally negative by some 70 mv), generally brought about"
by release of an excitatory neurotransmitter molecule (for general
details see ACETYLCHOLINE). This opens up Nat- and K+- ligand-
gated channels in the postsynaptic membrane and allows influx of
Nat and efflux of K+ along their electrochemical gradients; Cl-
channels remain closed if the transmitter is excitatory. Enzymic
degradation. of the transmitter restores these channels to their closed
"state, but current resulting from ion flow opens voltage-gated Nat-"

"‘and K+- channels in the adjacent memhrane, and the flow of ions"
"which results causes depolarization, further current flow along the"
#NAME?

Voltage-gated channels close again when depolarization in their
region reaches its peak. These combined causes and effects result in
propagation of an action potential away from the site of original
depolarization. Because the K+-channels open later than the Ngt-
"channels and stay open longer, the action potentialhas the characteris-"
tics shown in Fig. 35.
 

 

INBREEDING 292

 

"There is a period of less than 1 ms, when the Nat+-channels are"
"closing and the K+-channels are open, when the membrane is un-"
"tesponsive to ,a depolarizing current (the absolute refractory period)"
which because it is so short enables nerves to carry the rapid suc-
"cession of impulses (up to 2500 s-! for large diameter fibres, 250"
s-! for small diameter fibres) involved in information transfer. In
addition there is a recovery period (the relative refractory period)
after passage of an impulse during which stimuli must be of greater
strength than normal to cause a propagated impulse. It lasts about
2 ms from the end of the absolute refractory period. On stimula-
"tion, individual nerve or muscle fibres respectively either conduct"
"an impulse or contract, or they do not. There are no partial conduc-"
tions or contractions because of the statistical way in which their
membrane ion channels open: only when sufficient ligand-gated
channels are open (the threshold level) does sufficient depolariza-
tion occur to open adjacent voltage-gated channels (the all-or-none
rule). Their depolarizing effect in turn causes adjacent voltage-gated
channels to open in a reiterated fashion (accelerating positive feed-
"back). Unmyelinated nerves conduct at from 0.5-100 m. s~}, in-"
"creasing with diameter, myelinated axons conduct at around 120"
"m.s7!, Rise in temperature up to about 40°C increases conduction"
tate.

Depolarization of muscle sarcolemma occurs through release of
acetylcholine at NEUROMUSCULAR JUNCTIONS. Impulses are then
propagated along the sarcolemma in just the same way as along
"nerves, but are carried inwardly to myofibrils by transverse tubules."
"See RESTING POTENTIAL, MUSCLE CONTRACTION, GATED"
CHANNELS.

inereeoinc. Sexual reproduction involving fertilization between
"gametes ftom closely related individuals, or in its most extreme form"
between gametes from the same (usually haploid or diploid) in-
"dividual or genotype. Such selfing is not uncommon, even obligatory,"
"in some plants. One end of a continuum, with Ou t 8 R = ED In G at the"
other (see srezp1nc system). The process tends to produce hom-
"ozygosity at loci (at all loci instantaneously in haploid selfing), with"
expected disadvantages from the expression of deleterious alleles and
reduction in the level of genetic variance among offspring (see cen «
tic varzarion). However many plant populations which both
"outbreed and inbreed (eg. Viola, violets, and gynodioecious species)"
"may, by regular exposure to selection of rare alleles with recessive"
"deleterious effects, be ‘purged’ of two such alleles for each death"

295 INFLORESCENCE

 

Industrial melanism provides one of the best examples of evolution
“within species and of selection resulting in po.ymorpatssm; but not
all melanism is necessarily adaptive against visual predation. Thermal
"melanism has been suggested in one ladybird (Adalia bipunctata), in"
which dark forms absorb more energy in regions where atmospheric
"soot lowers levels of incident solar radiation, They warm up earlier in"
"the season, and gain a reproductive benefit by being mobile sooner"
than non-melanics. The precise roles of migration and predation on
gene frequencies in industrial melanism have yet to be elucidated.

InFtammation. Local response to injury in vertebrates; also involved
in atte rey. Involves vasodilation and increased permeability of
capillaries in damaged area due largely to release of s St a mu In e and

INFLORESCENCE. Collective term for specific arrangement of flowers
"on an axis, grouped according to the method of branching, into: a)"
"indefinite, or racemose; b) definite, or cymose. In a), branching is"
"monopodial, inflorescences consisting of a main axis which increases"
"in length by growth at its tip, giving rise to lateral flower-bearing"
"branches. These open in succession from below upwards or, if the"
"inflorescence axis is short and flattened, from the outside inwards."
"The following are recognized (see Fig. 36): k a cemz, whose main"
"axis bears stalked flowers PANI cz, compound raceme, such as oat,"
"co ry Ms, raceme with flowers borne at the same level due to clonga-"
"tion of the stalk (pedicel) of lower flowers, e.g. candytuft; serxz,"
"raceme with sessile flowers, eg. plantain, $P aorx, spike with fleshy"
"axis, e.g. cuckoo pint; carxis, spike of unisexual, reduced and"
"often pendulous flowers, eg. hazel, birch, UMBEL, raceme in which"
"the axis has not lengthened, the Rowers arising at the same point to"

INFRASPECIFIC variation. Variation within species. It takes several
"different forms. Clarification depends on population structure,"
BR EE DING SY §T EM and effectiveness Of gene flow Of the particular
case. Clines refer to variable phenotypic characters whose distribu-
tions display gradients mappable geographically on to gradients in
environmental conditions. Morph ratio clines occur when the ratios
of different morphs change in a similarly graded way. Phenotypic
plasticity may be the cause but where genetic fixation is involved the
variation may be closer to ecotypic. Ecotypes involve adaptation of
"populations to local edaphic, climatic or biotic influences. A form in"
botany is the category within the species generally applied to members

showing trivial variations from normal (e.g. in petal colour). In
"zoology the term is often synonymous with morph (see below), or"
"else a seasonal variant, or used as a neutral term when it is unclear"
"whether a species, subspecies or lesser category is appropriate. A"
morph is one form of a polymorphic species population (see POLY -
MORPHISM) .

A race is a non-formal category used chiefly in zoological contexts.
Geographical races approximate to subspecies (see later). Host races
are those species populations with the same favoured hosts (if
"parasites) or food plants (when egg-laying, feeding, etc); such prefer-"
ences may involve various genetic and non-genetic influences. A
subspecies is a formal taxonomic category used to denote various
"forms (types), commonly geographically restricted, of a polytypic"
species. It should ideally be used of evolutionary lineages rather than
mere phenetic subdivisions of a species. Most easily applied when a
population is geographically isolated from other populations of the
"species (e.g. on an island, mountain top). Subspecific status is"
often conferred on populations which are really part of a clinal
series for the characters used but where intermediate populations
have not been studied. In some groups (e.g. Diptera) taxonomists
have dispensed with the category. A variety is a formal category in
botany below the level of subspecies and is used of groups which
"differ, for various reasons, from other varieties within the same  sub-"
species.

Instinct. Behaviour which comprises a stereotyped pattern or se-
"quence of patterns, typically remains unaltered by experience, appears"
in response to a restricted range of stimuli and without prior op-
portunity for practice. Distinction between this and leamt behaviour
has been blurred by research in the last two decades: attention has
focused upon developmental pathways of different behavioural re-

such behaviour tends still to be termed instinctive.

Insutin. Protein hormone comprising 51 amino acids in two chains
held together by disulphide bridges. Secreted by beta-cells of  verte-

Inversion. (1) A type of chromosome worarron in which a
"section of chromosome is cut out, tured through 180” and rejoined,"
"or spliced back, to the chromosome upside down. If long enough, it"
results in an inversion loop in eo t x tm NE or meiotic cells heterozygous
for the inversion. The inverted region is stretched in order to pair up
"homologously with its partner, as shown in Fig. 38."

If crosSinc-over occurs within the inversion loop then the
"chromosomes which result are nearly always abnormal, having either"
"deletions, duplications, too many centromeres or none at all (acen-"
tric). This normally results in reduced fertility. See SUPERGENE.

JACOB-MONOD THeory. An influential theory of prokaryotic cenz
"expresston, Of value in the explanation of eukaryotic gene ex-"
"pression. Its basic concept is that of the operon, a unit of m A wom -"
"TION, comprising a group of adjacent structural genes(CISTRONS)"
"on the chromosome, headed by a non-coding DNA sequence (the"
"operator) whose configuration binds a protein (the repressor, or"
regulator) encoded by a regulator gene elsewhere on the chromosome
"(see Fig. 39). In one model, the repressor binds the operator preventing"
the enzyme RNA polymerase from gaining access to an adjacent
"DNA sequence (the promoter), which it must do if any of the"
structural genes of the operon are to be transcribed. The repressor—
"operator complex is stable and only broken if another molecule, the"
"inducer, binds to it, in which case the inducer-repressor complex"
loses its’affinity for the operator and transcription of the operon’s
"cisttons results. This serves to explain prokaryotic enzyme induction,"
"where the presence of substrate, acting directly or indirectly as"
"inducer, is required for an enzyme to be produced by a cell. In one"
"model of enzyme repression, the repressor does not bind to the"
"operator until it has itself bound to some other molecule, the co-"
"repressor (eg. enzyme product, or other gene product). Only then will"
transcription of the operon be inhibited. Mutants in the repressor
"gene, affecting repressor shape so that it cannot bind the operator or"
"the corepressor, will result in consTITUTIVE production of the"
operon’s cistron products. One observation which the theory helped
explain was that in the bacterium Escherichia coli the enzymes
encoded by what is now referred to as the Jae operon were either all
"produced together or not produced at all. Other regulatory genes,"
"especially in eukaryotes, encode rranscriprron Factors, Which"
bind upstream of genes and assist binding of R N A polymerase to
thepromotor.See wuchzar RecePrors.

313 KINASE

 

a common excretory duct in vertebrates. Functional units in verte-
"brates, kidney tubules or sephrons, were probably originally paired in"
"each trunk segment and drained through a pair of ducts, one on each"
"side of the body (see WOLFFIAN ovvucr). In higher vertebrates,"
anterior tubules (forming what remains of the pronephros) are embry-
"onic and transitory, kidney function being normally dominated by"
"the  opisthonephros — (mesonephros and metanephros), whose — segmental"
"organization is all but lost in the adult, a new excretory duct (the"
ureter) draining from the mass of nephrons into the bladder. The
mesonephros is the functional kidney in adult fish and amphibians.
"In embryonic amniotes the two kidneys are initially mesonephric,"
"lying in the trunk, their nephrons having glomeruli and coiled tubules,"
but the whole structure loses tts urinary role during development and
in males becomes invaded by the vasa efferentia. Each mesonephric
duct gives offureteric buds which grow into the intermediate mes-
"oderm and develop into the collecting ducts, pelvis and ureter — in"
due course draining the metanephros. Each bud gives mise to a cluster
"of capillaries, a glomerulus, and a long tubule differentiating into"
"Bowman’s capsule, proximal convoluted tubule, loop of Henle and"
"distal convoluted tubule, joming the collecting duct. Units developing"
"from the cap tissue are termed mephrons, most of whose components"
"lie in the kidney cortex, only the loops of Henle lying in the medulla,"

where they join the collecting ducts. Over a million nephrons may
occur in each mammalian  metanephros.

Hydrostatic pressure in the blood forces water and low molecular
mass solutes (not proteins) out of the glomeruli into the Bowman’s
capsules. In mammals 80% of this glomerular filtrate is then reab-
sorbed across the cells of the proximal convoluted tubule by ract u «
TATED oirruston and acrive ransporr into capillaries of
the vasa recta draining the kidney. The descending and ascending
limbs oftheloop of Henle form a counrercurrenr system
whose activesecretion and selective permeabilities result in a high
"salt concentration in the interstitial fluid of the medulla, enabling"
water to be drawn back into the medulla osmotically from the
collecting ducts if these are rendered permeable by aANTIDIURETIC
"wor wong. Urea is also reabsorbed, but never against a concentra-"
"tion gradient, half being excreted on each journey through the"
kidneys. Kidneys play a major role in osmoregulation and help
"regulate blood pH by controlling loss of HCO,- and H+. The"

environments ~ changes which for Lamarck altered an organism’s
needs-andhabits. He held (as did Geoffroy St. Hilaire) that continu-
ous spontaneous generation was required to restock the lowest life
forms which had evolved into more complex ones.

For Lamarck the mechanism of evolutionary change was environ-
mental: organs which assist an organism in its altered conditions are
strengthened (e.g. the giraffe has acquired its high shoulders and
long neck by straining to reach higher and higher into trees for
leaves}; others progressively atrophy through disuse. Such acquired
"characters, he thought, were then inherited. But there were and are"
"no clear examples of such inheritance, nor does this theory account"
satisfactorily for evolutionary stability (stasis). It would require a
theory of inheritance completely at variance with that receiving

LEAF 322

 

Lear. Major photosynthesizing and transpiring organ of bryophytes
"and vascular plants; those of the former are simpler, non-vascular"
"and not homologous with those of the latter, which consist usually"
"of a leaf stalk (petiole), attached to stem by tear mse, the leaf"
blade typically lying flattened on either side of the main vascular
"strand, or midrib. The lamina is often lobed or toothed, possibly"
reducing the mean distance water travels from main veins to sites of
"evaporation, helping to cool the leaf. Hairy leaves probably reduce"
"insect damage, as may latex channels, resin ducts, essential oils,"
tannins and calcium oxalate crystals. Some leaves produce hydrogen
"cyanide when damaged. During evolution, leaves have become"
"modified to serve in reproduction, either sexually (as sPoR »"
oO pa x tt 38) or asexually (as producers of propagating -buds). Leaves
of higher plants usually have a bud in their axils and are important
"producers of GROWTH SUBSTANCES. See corTyLEDoN,,"

leaf; attached to the stem.

"LEAF BLADE (LAMINA). [hin, flattened and flexible portion of a .zar;"
"major site of PHoTosynTHESIs and = cransrrrarron, forwhichit"
is admirably adapted. May be simple (comprising one piece) or
"compound (divided into separate parts, leaflets, each attached by a"
stalk to the petiole). A typical dicotyledon leaf presents a large
"surface area, photosynthesizing cells being arranged immediately"
below the upper epidermis allowing maximum solar energy absorp-
tion. The blade is provided with a system of supporting veins bringing
water and mineral nutrients and removing photosynthetic products.
Has a system of intercellular spaces opening to the atmosphere
"through sromara, permitting regulated gaseous exchange and loss"
"of water vapour; its thinness reduces diffusion distances for gases,"
"keeping their concentration gradients steep, so increasing diffusion"
rates. Its large surface area and transpiration rate help cooling.

Lire. Complex physico-chemical systems whose two main peculiarities
are (1) storage and replication of molecular information in the form

"is inert, not alive, however, such systems may still count as biological"
(e.g. all viruses away from their hosts). Other familiar properties of
"living _systems__such__as__nutrition,__respiration,_ reproduction, _ excretion"

 

"irritability, locomotion, etc., are all ‘dependent in some way upon"
their exhibiting the two above-mentioned properties.

Living systems also have an evolutionary history. Whatever the .

"oR IG rn 0 F uire may have been, all evisting life forms derive ftom"
living antecedents. The earliest living system would have been very
"different from any modern life form, particularly so in their genetic"
systems (modes of storage and implementation of molecular informa-
tion).

Lire cyc.e. Progressive series of changes undergone by an organism
or a lineal succession of organisms from fertilization to death of the
stage producing the gametes beginning an identical series of changes.
"Life cycles, as much as phenotypes, display adaptation to the extemal"
environment. Even within a species there may be more than one way
in which a generation can be completed. There may in particular be
considerable variation in methods of reproduction. Sometimes this
involves an alternation of generations (metagenesis) between distinct
sexual and asexual individuals. The simplest form of life cycle is
"purely asexva,, involving repeated binary fission and/or budding."
In eukaryotes sexual life cycles may be classified according to whether

~or not haploid mitosis and/or diploid mitosis occur (see Fig. 42).

"“Such life cycles may be either (a) haplontic, in which only haploid"
"cells can divide by mitosis, the diplophase being represented by a"
"single nucleus (eg. Spirogyra, Chlamydomonas, Mucor), (b) diplontic,"
"in which only diploid cells can divide by mitosis, all haploid cells"
"being immediate products of meiosis (e.g. most animals), or (c)"
"haplodiplontic (or diplohaplontic), in which both haploid and diploid"
mitoses can occur. Haplophase and diplophase may be more or less
"equally prominent (e.g. the alga Ulva), or one may be dominant"
"(haplophase in mosses and liverworts, diplophase in ferns and seed"
plants). In most ‘haplodiplontic cases (yeasts are somewhat variable)
"gametes are produced by mitosis, and a mitotic product of the zygote"
undergoes meiosis.

"and to the diplophase as the sporophyte. Some plants, such as the"

reduced mitotic products. Although development of ‘gametophytic
"heterospory, begun in ferns, has been taken far further in flowering"
"plants, it is the sporophyte that has become the dominant phase from"
ferns to seed plants; probably indicating a greater robustness and

"LINKAGE. Two or more loci (see Locus), and their representative"
"‘genes, are ‘said to be linked if they occur on the same chromosome."
Such loci normally occur in the same linear sequence on all homo-
"logous chromosomes, so that chromosomes form linkage groups."

"Contrary to the second of MENDEL’s Laws of inheritance, eukary-"
otic genes which are linked (forming part of a chromosome) will tend
to pass together into nuclei produced by m EIOSI § and are not
"randomly assorted. This is very important, because whereas there is"
an equal statistical probability of all combinations of unlinked genes
ending up in a given nucleus after meiosis (simply through the
"behaviour of non-homologous chromosome’ pairs), genes which are"
linked can only ‘be prevented -from passing together into nuclei by
"CROSSING-OVER, or bysome chromosome MUTATION such as trans-"
"location, which separates them (see LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM)."
The events of meiosis create new linkage groups and thereby new sets
of phenotypic characters in organisms upon which SELECTION can
act. Without linkage (i.e. without chromosomes) selection could
never alter the probabilities with which characters appear together in
"different individuals of a population, and adaptation and evolution"
in so far as we understand them could not have occurred. Linkage
makes possible the selection of coadapted combinations of alleles of
"different gene loci, which will tend to be transmitted together. Because"
rates of crossing-over between loci can be altered by selection (see
"MA P D ISTAN CE), adaptive combinations of genes, and of their"
"resulting character combinations, can be preserved rather than dis-"
"rupted by meiosis. See CHROMOSOME MAPPING, RECOMBINA-"

349 MEIOSIS

 

Meiosis (REDUCTION DIVISION). Process whereby a nucleus divides by
"two divisions into four nuclei, each containing half the original"
"number of chromosomes, in most cases forming a genetically non-"
uniform haploid set (see Fig. 46). A necessary aspect of eukaryotic
"sexual reproduction, for without it fertilization would usually double"
the chromosome number every generation. Meiosis ensures that all
gamete nuclei from diploid parents contain a haploid set of chromo-
"somes. It also ensures, in sexually outbred populations at least, wide"
GENETIC wriation between offspring. This results from genetic
"recomprnaTIOoN, both random and non-random."

The first meiotic division is initiated by DNA replication (S
"phase), so that each chromosome comes to comprise two sister"

"—_—______chromatids,_as—in—mitesis; .but-e++the-start—f-prephase—the—sistee"

"chromatids of each chromosome remain tightly together, their early"
appearance (/eptotene) giving the impression of unreplicated chromo-
somes. They remain attached to the nuclear membrane. Chromosomes
"then pair up homologously (zygotene), as a synaptonemal complex"
develops between them holding them together (synapsis). Each such
pair is termed a bivalent; but where there is little homology (e.g.
between sex chromosomes as in the heterogametic sex of most’ verte-
brates) synapsis is only partial. Completion of synapsis is‘followed by
"shortening and thickening of the bivalents (pachytene), during which"
"interval, often ° lasting for days c R OSS ING -QVez e occurs between"

"non-sister chromatids, producing recombination between homologous"
chromosomes. The synaptonemal complex then dissolves (diplotene)
"and the two homologous chromosomes fall apart, except where"
crossing-over holds them together at one or more visible chiasmata
Chromosomes begin to unwind (decondense) and may commence
"RNA transcription again. At diakinesis, any RNA synthesis ceases"
"(but Se@ ampprusu curomosomes); bivalents shorten, thicken"
and detach from the nuclear membrane. For the first time they
"appear as four distinct chromatids, linked at their centromeres and"

chiasmata.

"After first meiotic prophase, the nuclear membrane disintegrates"
"and at (first metaphase bivalents lie on the midline of the cell, between"
"the two poles. To commence first anaphase the spindle fibres, attached"
"to kinetochores of the centromeres, then pull the two members of"
"each bivalent to opposite poles, the sister chromatids appearing"
somewhat more ‘splayed out’ than at mitotic anaphase. Chance
"governs which pole each chromosome of a bivalent moves to, ensuring"
random recombination between non-homologous chromosomes.
"Each of the two sets of chromosomes produced is us e LOI», although"
each dyad has chromatids of mixed parental origin. A short first
telophase and interphase may follow; or the second meiotic division
"proceeds at once. Nuclear membranes normally reform, chromosomes"
"decondensing, then recondensing, at a brief second prophase. The"

stocks (Pisum is self-fertile} pure-breeding for one or more characters;
stocks which could be selfed and crossed in large numbers, re-
ciprocally when necessary, whose seeds and offspring could be scored
for several pairs of contrasting characters used. He carried out both
monohybrid and dihybrid crosses. Since, as is now realized, the pairs
of characters studied were determined by unlinked loci, he was able
to obtain offspring in ratios enabling the subsequent formulation of
laws of inheritance. His greatest conceptual innovation was to regard
heritable factors determining characters as atomistic and material
particles which neither fused nor blended with one another - a
conclusion inescapable in the light of the experimental results he
obtained. Mendel was elected Abbot of Bmo monastery in 1868. His

MENDELIAN HEREDITY (M. inHeritance, MENDELISM). The view, expressed
here in modern terminology, that in eukaryotic genomes alleles
segregate (separate into different nuclei) dunng » 2 108] s, after which  ,
any-member of a pair of alleles has equal probability of finding itself
ina nucleus with either of the members of any other pair (if the loci
are unlinked). As a result of chromosome behaviour during meiosis
and fertilization, and of dominance and recessiveness among charac-
ters, ratios of characters among offspring phenotypes are _ predictable,
given knowledge of the parental genotypes.

Men pEL Was unaware of the genetic role of chromosomes (see
Gee,WE:1 SMa Np), and studied inheritance of variation determined
by unlinked allelic differences of major effect. He was also unaware
of potycente INHERITANCE and LINKAGE , both of which are
liable to’ cause departures from Mendelian ratios in breeding work.
Linkage provides a clear exception to the law of independent assort-
ment (see’MEN oveL's 1a ws). Mendelian ratios may also be distorted
by MUTATION, SEX-LINKAGE, MEIOTIC DRIVE, CYTOPLASMIC
INHERITANCE, MATERNAL EFFECT, EPISTASIS and by SELEC—"
Tron among embryos or gamete types. MALE HA PLOI D Y will also
"result in distortions; but even here, as with sex-linkage, alleles behave"
in a basically’ Mendelian way. It is simply that the genetic system
produces non-Mendelian ratios in breeding — work.

MENDEL’S Laws. This account of the laws uses terminology which
Mendel did not employ himself:

"First Law, of Segregation: during meiosis, the two members of any"
pair of alleles possessed by an individual separate (segregate) into
"different gametes and subsequently into different offspring, neither"
having blended with nor altered the other in any way while together
in the same cell (but see cenz converston). The law asserts-that
alleles retain their integrities (barring mutation) during replication
"from generation to generation. None of the cells normally produced ,"
by meiosis contains two alleles from any locus.
 

353 MENSTRUAL GYCLE

 

"Second Law, of Independent Assortment: asserts that during meiosis"
"‘all combinations of alleles are distributed, to daughtei nuclei with"
"equal’ probability, distribution of ‘members of one’ pair having no"
"influence on the distribution of members of any other pair. It holds,"
"in effect, that during meiosis random reassortment occurs between"
alleles at different loci. Thus if one locus is represented by the two
"alleles A and @; while another locus is represented by alleles B and b,"
"then all four haploid nuclei AB, aB, Ab and ab will be formed in"
‘equal frequency by meiosis. Mendel’s second law is refuted by 1 1 wx -.

"MICROSCOPE, mICROSCoPY. Microscopes are instruments employing"
"lenses to produce magnified images, and hence fine detail, of objects"
too small to observe clearly with the naked eye. Earliest light micro-
scopes (visible light as the transmitted medium) appeared in about
1590 in Holland and had fwo glass lenses. In these compound micr-
"scopes one short focal length lens, the eye-piece lens,” produces a"
magnified apparent image of a rea] image produced by a. second
"short focal length lens, the objective lens, placed closer to the object."
Total magnification is the product of the magnifications produced by
"these two lenses. Hooke (1665) first recorded cells in cork, and"
"Leeuwenhgeek first noted’infusoria (1676) and bacteria (1683), which"
were first stained by von Gleichen (1778). In the 1870s E. Abbe and
C. Zeiss produced the first oil-immersion objective lens enabling a
good image of up to x]500 magnification. Achromatic and aplanatic
objective lenses (the finest available to this day) were developed by J.
"J. Lister, those of 1886 from Zeiss being of a very high quality."

"The thinner the material being observed, the greater the clarity of"
"image, hence the improvement of embedding, cutting and sectioning"
methods to match the’evolution of the microscope. Light reflected
from a point object cannot be recombined again to form another true
"point, but only a dise of light. When discs representing adjacent"
object points overlap detail is lost. The resolving power of 4 micro-
"scope, its ability to distinguish fine detail, is proportional. to, the"
wavelength of the transmitted medium. Visible light has a wavelength
of about 0.5 ym and the best resolying power(even-using visible light
 

MICROSOMES 362

 

of the shortest wavelength) is about 045 ym. Objects closer together
will not be resolved as more than one object. Where an object (eg. a
"typical cell) is transparent, with features differing only in refractive"
"index, light rays will emerge with different phase relations depending"
on the paths they have taken. The resulting image has uniform
"brightness, but the technique of phase contrast microscopy makes use"
of its phase differences so as to produce the image that would have
been seen had these been amplitude differences.

Electron microscopes use wave properties of lectrons fired — through
"the object held in a vacuum. In transmission electron ‘microscopes,"
electrons are accelerated through the microscope by a large voltage
"(up to 1000 kV), those passing through the object hitting a screen,"

~-which- fluoresces-- giving an image:~The~electrons -are~focused-by-~ ~~

electron magnets. The wavelength of electrons is inversely related to
"the voltage used, but even in low voltage apparatus is about 0.005"
nm = four orders of magnitude (10*) less than that of a light wave.
Resolving power of the order of: 1 nm for biological material (less for
crystals) is achievable. This is about 200 times better than in light
microscopy. Materials for observation are commonly first fixed and
then embedded in Araldite® prior to sectioning by an ultramicro-
"tome, giving sections 20-100 nm thick. The dangers of so, generating"
artefacts are well known and are avoided as far as possible. Biological
material contains few heavy atoms and consequently its electron-
"scattering ability is poor, but can be improved by soaking the object"
"in, or spraying it with, a salt of a heavy metal (‘staining’: it). In"
scanning’electron microscopy the electron beam causes the object to
emit its own electrons. These can be used to produce an image which
-is built up as the electron beam scans the specimen (rather in the way
a television picture is produced). Micrographs produced have a
"three-dimensional quality, but lower resolution than in transmission"
microscopy. One technique often employed for looking at hydro-
"phobic interiors of membranes is freeze-fracture electron microscopy,"
in which cells are frozen in ice to-the temperature of liquid nitrogen
"(496°C) and then fractured, the plane of fracture tending to pass"
through the middles of lipid bilayers. Exposed fracture surfaces are
then shadowed with platinum and carbon followed by digestion of
"the organic content (freeze-etching), leaving aplatinum ‘replica’ which"
can be examined with the electron microscope. This is particularly
useful for detecting where proteins are located in membranes. In
"‘electron microscopy, the specimen is inevitably in a vacuum and"
exposed to high temperature electron bombardment; hence it is
"impossible to view living material, specimens requiring cooling during"
viewing.

some mutually beneficial evolved signal-response pairing between
"two organisms (one signalling, the other responding) has been simu-"
"lated or employed by a third party to its own advantage, often to the"
detriment of one or both of the original parties.

In Millerian mimicry (after F. Miller) two or more organisms
"independently derive protection from predation, for example by"
tasting repellent; but they also benefit mutually through convergent
"evolution ‘of similar warning (aposematic) colouration and pattern,"
predators learning by association to avoid both after tasting one. In
Batesian mimicry (after H. W. Bates) an edible or otherwise relatively
defenceless organism (the mimic) gains protection from predation by
"resemblance to a distasteful, poisonous or harmful organism, termed"
hte rrodel i this-case mt benefit- gained ‘wilt aepena’ny part upon
"the ratio of availabilities of models and mimics, predators tending to"
require reinforcement of the learnt association of colour/pattern and
disagreeableness. Some species (eg. certain butterflies) may be Bates-
jan mimics of more than one model (see POLY MORPHISM). In
"aggressive mimicry, the “mimic feeds on, one of the original parties"
in the original signal-response pairing. Some instances of ¢ ryrsis
(e.g. stick or leaf insects) may appear to overlap the criteria of
mimicry given above; but it can be argued that crypsis does not
involve manipulation of a true signal (as opposed to background
"noise) in the service of a new function. Many flowering plants,"
"notably several orchids, achieve pollination through mimicry of"
"signals (e.g. visual, olfactory) attracting specific insect pollinators."

New mitochondria arise by growth and division of existing mito-

to the original parent nucleus. Commonly accompanied by division
of parerital: cytoplasm (cytokinesis) around the daughter nuclei to
produce two’ daughter cells (cell division). It is the usual method by
"which nuclei are replicated during the growth, development and"
repair of multicellular organisms and coenocytic fungi. Prokaryotes
"lack nuclei and have no mitosis, replicating and segregating their"
DNA by a different process. Body cells (and nuclei} not undergoing
mitosis are typically in inrERPHase. The first stage of mitosis
(prophase) commences with the first appearance of condensed chrom-
"osomes, each consisting of two identical sister chromatids held to-"
gether by a cenrromere. In contrast to their behaviour in first
"meiotic prophase, homologous mitotic chromosomes do not normally"

 

~pair-up (see Fig: 48):

During prophase a spindle of m cr o 1 Us Ux es assembles outside
"the nucleus. If centrioles are present, they have replicated in S-phase"
(see cet. CYCLE) and form foci for origins of spindle fibres. The
two ASTERS get pushed apart by growth of microtubules. In meza-
Phase the nuclear membrane disintegrates and microtubules growing
from the KINETOCHORES of the chromosome centromeres attach to
"those of the spindle, the resulting agitation making all chromosomes"
come to lie in one plane (the metaphase plate) half way between the
two spindle poles. Each chromosome lies with its long axis at right
angles to the axis of the spindle. Metaphase may be quite lengthy.
"Anaphase begins when kinetochores separate, the two sister chroma-"
tids of a chromosome being pulled towards the opposite spindle
"poles, which move further apart. Each chromatid is now a chromo-"

on myosin. filaments will only bind to actin after they have been
"primed to do so by hydrolysis of ATP, whichveach head catalyses"
through its own ATPase activity. Only when ATP has been hy-
drolysed (ie. before contraction occurs) is the myosin head ready to
"attach to an actin filament, changing its own shape (allosterically} so"
as to pull the actin filament past it. It can then release its bound

"ADP and inorganic phosphate, hydrolyse another ATP molecule"
"(which requires magnesium ions, Mg++) and swing back ready for"
another power stroke. Repeated cycles of this sequence result in the
actin filament sliding along relative to myosin; and since in muscle

"cells actin filaments are bound to Z-discs, the H-zone in the middle"
of the contracting sarcomere will narrow and darken and the I-bands
disappear. the sarcomere has then fully contracted.

Striated muscle contracts with an ant-or-nonz response. It
relaxes only if ATP is available to free myosin from actin and if
Ca++ ions are actively removed from sarcoplasm by terminal cister-
"nae, which they are in the absence of action potentials along the"
sarcolemma (and transverse tubules). In the absence of ATP the

"puospuate compound, the PHOSPHAGEN creatinephosphate (phos-"
Phocreatine). If muscle is forced to contract repeatedly the amplitude
of contractions will’ decrease and ultimately fail altogether when
"energy resources are expended. Muscle, like nerve, has brief absolute"
and relative refractory periods (see 1 M eutse) after an action potential
has passed a point on its membrane. During these the membrane
becomes epolarized. The relative refractory period of striated muscle
"is much shorter than that of cardiac muscle, but longer than that of"
nerve.See TETANUS.

"S er wp tes maintain this tone, which is variable. The effect of training"
on muscles is mainly to increase capillary circulation and hence
diffusion rates of materials to and from muscle fibres. Endurance
training results in hypertrophy of muscle tissue.

Smooth muscle contractions are either tonic o¢ rhythmic. Some
smooth muscle is self-exciting (see m ocen ic). In tonic contractions
slow waves of electrical activity pass across adjacent cells; which are
often fused to form a syncytium. Bursts of action potentials then
cause .the *muscle. to contract in functional blocks when the waves
teach a sufficient intensity. © Parasympathetic stimulation _isresponsible
"for tonus in much of the vertebrate gut. Rhythmic contractions, of"
smooth muscle in-walls of tubular organs (peristaltic contractions)
are also due to rapid spikes of action potentials; but the initiating
"signal here is usually stretching of the, tube wall, which elicits contrac-"
"tion either directly or reflexly via local nerve plexuses, (see av ER -"
BACH’S PLEXUS).

commonly cause amino acid substitutions in the polypeptide encoded

"syndromes of abnormalities which seriously reduce Fr TNESS, and are"
more often lethal. Many point mutations fail to result in amino acid
"substitutions because the cznzrzc cope is degenerate; Others,"
"though altering amino acid sequence, either have little effect or only"
partially inactivate gene function (as in Jeaky auxotrophs’ of fungi

MYCORRHIZA 382

 

Mycoraniza. Symbiotic association between a fungus and the root
of a higher plant Mycorthizas are of common occurrence. Two main
"types exist: (a). endotrophic, in which the fungus is within the cortex"
"cells of the root, e.g. of orchids; and (b) ectotrophic, where it is"
"external, forming a mantle that completely invests the smaller roots,"

"eg. of pine trees. Mycorrhizal plants benefit from the association, in"
ectotrophic forms particularly by the fungal transport of ions (e.g.
"phosphate), which are otherwise relatively immobile in the soil, into"
the plant roots. Distributions of some plants are limited by  distribu-
"tion of the appropriate mycorrhizal fungus, vital as it may be for"
establishment and growth of seedling trees of several species (e.g.
pines). Association of the fungus with the tree is necessary for
ion-of the-fungus.-Plants-grown in-soils——
"which have had excess artificial fertilizer added, or which have been"

In the Krebs cycle the oxidized form of the coenzyme (NAD+)
receives one hydrogen atom from isocitrate (under the influence of
"isocitrate dehydrogenase) to become NADH, while another hydro-"
gen atom from the isocitrate becomes a proton:

could predict the kind to which an organism belonged given know-
ledge only. of those facts about it that materially caused tt to be.a

NaturaL SELECTION (setection). Most -widely accepted theory
concerning the principal causal mechanism of evolutionary change
"(‘descent with modification’), propounded by Charles var own and"
"Alfred Russel WA tt a cz. The theory asserts that, given diversity"
(both genetic and phenotypic) among individuals making up a species
"population, not all individuals in the population at time ¢, will"
contribute equally to the make-up of the population at a subsequent
"time t , To the extent that this is due to the effects of heritable"
"differences upon individuals, natural selection has acted. i"

Confusion arises .over the use of Herbert Spencer’s phrase “the
survival of the fittest’. Individual organisms do not survive through
"geological time (unlike some evolutionary lineages), but what they"
"inherit and pass on does: that is, canes (see ountr oF sELEC~"
ron). The theory of natural selection asserts that the genetic com-
position of an evolutionary lineage will change through time by non-
random transmission of genes from one parental generation to the
"next, a non-randomness (‘selection’) due solely to the fact that not all"
"gene combinations are equally suited to a given environment, and"
that consequently individuals differ in their biological (Darwinian)
"ritmess. Constraints upon phenotype from the environment, which"
"produce this differential gene transmission, are termed ‘selection pres-"
sure’. It is commonly assumed that all regular components of a
"species’ phenotype have been favoured by natural selection, but evolu."
tion may sometimes result from causes other than natural selection
(See GENETIC DRIFT). —

system which is b) sufficiently discrete from other such systems to
enable its collection of properties to be a unit in reproductive competi-

"on simple genetic (information) systems engaging int least initially,"
"autocatalysis, with subsequent expansion of the stored information"
to code for molecules which do not themselves store information but
instead form part of the structure of the system.

Even the simplestliving systems today are far too complicated to
resemble at all closely the earliest forms of life. Three major features
"of present living systems (construction from complex, often polyme-"
"ric, organic compounds; catalysis by proteins; storage of molecular,"
information in the form of nucleic acid) are likely to be the end
results of evolution by ‘natural selection between systems which were
originally far simpler and lacked all these features. The following
"account is highly, conjectural, but raises some of, the, issues being"
debated. .

For long it was thought that the early Earth’s atmosphere consisted
"of reducing molecules (ammonia, methane, hydrogen and water"
"vapour), and attempts to create likely precursor molecules of life"
"' (amino acids, bases) by passing electrical sparks through such gaseous"
mixtures were rewarding. -However it is probable that four thousand
million years ago the sun was weaker in terms of ‘ total thermal
"output than it is now, and more active in terms of ultraviolet output."
Implications for the Earth’s early atmosphere and the origin of life
"are that: a) without an atmospheric creennous'z errect, the sur-"
face temperature of the Earth would have been too low to avoid ocean
"freezing, and that b) incident ultraviolet radiation on the Earth’s"
atmosphere would have resulted in photolysis of methane and am-
"monia, releasing free hydrogen out of the atmosphere, with probable"
retention of carbon dioxide and atomic and molecular nitrogen. The
carbon dioxide could have provided the greenhouse effect: the early
oceans were not frozen.

"compounds which, by permeating rock, could fotm complex molecules,"
cooled sufficiently by the water to reduce the likelihood of their
"dissociation. These, in association with the self-assembling crystalline"
"organization provided by such clays as huolinites and illites, could come"
to form polyniers supported by the lattice of tic crystal.

promoting their enlargement by incorporation of further membrane
"components, as can happen with artificial L1POosomes. Rupture of"
the spheres followed by renewed growth of the rupture products
would have achieved a simple form of reproduction.

"In the past, RNA may have had wider catalytic ability than it has"
"now. (see rezomere). If RNA were, among early polymers, formed"
"pethaps on clay crystals trapped within membrane spheres, and were"
"it to catalyse amino acid polymerization, then, protein synthesis"
"might gain independence from clay crystals, RNA also supporting"
the protein. If some of these proteins were to associate with the
Membrane in such a way as to stabilize it and even promote entry of

"building materials, selection could have favoured those systems which"
in replicating retained catalytic production of the membrane proteins
by RNA; that is; which achieved the reproducible link between
genotype and phenotype.’ Something ike a simple cell would have
been produced. DNA could eventually have been synthesized off the

OSMOREGULATION 412

 

behaviour may .reduce osmotic dangers; thus limpets adhere closely
to rocks at low tide; marine mussels and periwinkles retract into
shells. Euryhaline animals tolerate wide fluctuations in water
"potentials of their surroundings, possibly through a limited ability to"
swell in hypotonic conditions and by a reduction in intracellular
"levels of some organic compounds, or inorganic ions such as sodium"
and chloride. Some engage in active ion uptake (eg. of sodium) if the
external medium becomes dilute enough to cause sodium loss by
"diffusion. Unless urine can be made hypotonic to body fluids, in-"
"organic ions will be lost by this route, and a kidney which reabsorbs"
ions from the excretory fluid will reduce this loss. an a p Ro mo us
"animals, such as-many cyclostomes and some fish, automatically take"

"__up water in freshwater but produce a copious hypotonic urine, active"

ion uptake by the gills’replacing urinary loss. On return to marine
conditions they lose water to the sea and correct this by drinking sea
"water. sodium, potassium and chloride are absorbed by the intestine"
and excreted across the gills (see sop] UM PUMP).

Restriction of water loss on land is associated with evolutionary
change from excretion of ammonia (ammonotely) to urea (ureotely)
and uric acid (uricotely). Amphibian metamorphosis includes a
change from ammonotely to ureotely; land reptiles produce a urine
"hypotonic to body fluids, but because of uricotely (uric acid being"
insoluble requires only incidental water in its removal) the total
volume produced is not great. Evolution of the aw IOTI c ze
would have been less likely without the uricotely of reptilian and bird
"embryos. Marine birds and reptiles do not regularly drink sea water,"
but they absorb much salt from their food and excrete it through salt
glands above the orbits of the eyes.

"« Vertebrate xronzy s, especially mammalian, can 1 produce a urine"
which is variably copious and hypotonic to body fluids or sparse and
"hypertonic, depending upon the water balance of the body. The"
"hypothalamus monitors blood concentration, and any increase above"
the homeostatic norm results in release ofp AN TIDIURETIcHORMONE
by the posterior prrurrary. This causes uptake of water by the
"collecting ducts and reduced volume of hypertonic urine. Moreover, the"
"hypothalamic thirst centre now initiates drinking, restoring blood"
concentration. Sudden loss of blood volume (or pressure) causes
aldosterone release from the ADRENAL cortex (see ANGIOTENSINS).
"This increases potassium excretion and sodium retention by the kidney,"
tending to make extracellular (tissue) fluid more concentrated than body
"cell fluid, lowering its water potential and drawing water out from the"
"cells to help restore blood volume. After a blood meal, the bug Rhodhnius"
disposes of excess fluid by release of a diuretichormone from tts thoracic
"ganglia. This accelerates active secretion of sodium ions from the gut,"
". chloride and water following them into the haemocoele, where they are"
dealt with by MALPIGHIAN ‘uputes. Osmoregulation may therefore
"involve structural, physiological ~and ~~ behavioural —_ adaptations."
 

413 OSSIFICATION

 

Osmosis. The net diffusion of water across a selectively permeable
"membrane (permeable in both directions to water, but varyingly"
*permeable to solutes) from one solution into another of lower w a 1 &
POTENTIAL. The osmotic pressure of a solution is the pressure which

must be exerted upon it to prevent passage of distilled water into it
"across a semipermeable membrane (one impermeable to all solutes,"
"but freely permeable to solvent), and is usually measured in _pascals,"
Pa (L Pa= 1 Newton/m?). The plasmalemma is selectively (i.e. not
semi-) permeable and permits selective passage of solutes (sce ce ut
"nd EMBRAN &S), as does the tonoplast in plant cells. ~"

The osmotic pressure of a solution depends upon the ratio between
the number of solute and solvent particles present in a given volume:

+ mole-of an undissociated {non-electrolytic) substance dissolved -in }
dm of water at 0 °C has an osmotic pressure of 2.26 M Pa (mega-
pascals). But a solution of 0.01 mole of sodium chloride per dm’ of
water has almost twice the osmotic pressure of a solution of 0.01
mole of glucose per dm? of water. This is because sodium chloride in
water dissociates almost completely into Nat and Cl- ions (giving
twice the particle number) whereas glucose does not dissociate in
water. Solutions of equal osmotic pressure are isotonic; one with a
"lower osmotic pressure than another is Aypotonic to it, the latter"
being Aypertonic to the former.

When cells produce polymers ftom component monomers they may
dramatically-reduce the osmotic pressure of their cytoplasm; hence
"polymers (e.g. starch, glycogen) make good storage compounds be-"
cause they are osmotically inactive. Glucose is far more osmotically
active than is starch.

"Osmosis is a physical process of great importance to all organisms,"
affecting relations -with their environments as well as between their
component cells. If an animal cell takes up water osmotically its
plasma membrane will eventually rupture (osmotic shock); but the
SOD 1U M Pump reduces this problem under normal physiological
conditions. Cells with cell walls are normally prevented from osmotic
rupture. Those which lose water osmotically shrink and become
plasmolysed (see pwaswowysts). Water relations of cells and
organisms are generally discussed in terms of water potential. See

OUTBREEDING. Effect of any mechanism which tends to ensure
that gametes which fuse at fertilization produce zygotes with a higher
degree of heterozygosity than they otherwise would. Darwin realized
"that many plants (e.g: orchids, primroses) are structurally adapted to"
"cross-pollination, and subsequent work on the “genetics of in-"
"compatibility mechanisms, preventing self-fertilization, has shown"
that selection must favour such plants under certain conditions.
Mechanisms promoting outbreeding include having separate sexes
"~{see DIOECIOUS), DICHOGAMY, HETEROSTYLY, INCOMPATI-"
"et LJ wm mechanisms and, commonly in animals, the social structure"
of the breeding group (e.g. incest taboos in humans). Advantage

of outbreeding in sexual populations is that it serves to free genetic
variability in the population to selection and thereby reduces evo-
lutionary stagnation of the population (see czNerzc varzarzion) .

includes non-gametic forms of AUTOMIXIS and in animals is a

sence of males) enables rapid production of offspring Without food
competition from males. Cyclical parthenogenesis (as in ‘Some aphids

"“the only carbon-fixing process on Earth, and the route by which"

virtually all energy enters the biosphere.

"Occurs in two stages: (a) a light-trapping phase, in which light"
energy (photons) initiates photochemical reactions on pigment mole-
"cules, producing energy-tich compounds (AT P and N AD PH) with"
"release of molecular oxygen (plants only), This is often called the"

enzymes located off the pigment molecules use products of the light
"phase and incorporate (fix) carbon dioxide, using the atoms of its"
(inorganic) molecules to synthesize more organic molecules. Energy
"for this carbon-fixation comes from ,A TP and.N A D PH produced"

"of photosystem, each containing a specific form of chlorophyll a."
"That of photosystem II, chlorophyll agg 9, donates a pair of excited"
electrons (excitons) to an organic receptor molecule. The electrons
lost are replaced by a pair from a water molecule as protons and
molecular oxygen 1s released into the thylakoid space. In the other
"photosystem, photosystem I, chlorophyll a1), donates an electron"
"pair to another organic receptor which, assisted by a rerrepoxin"
"molecule, reduces NADP to release N ADPH into the chloroplast"
"stroma, Electrons lost are replaced by those from chlorophyll agg"
after they have passed along an ELECTRON cransporr system
which includes cytochromes. In this process energy is released to
drive protons from the stroma across the thylakoid membrane into
"--the thylakeid_spaces,-diffusing-out through an AT Pase-in r"

brane and releasing sufficient energy for synthesis of AT P from A D P
and inorganic’ phosphate. The whole electron and proton flow se-
quence is called non-cyclic photophosphorylation. After electrons have
left the chlorophyll a9) of photosystem I they may short-circuit
back again via some of the electron transport molecules. This
"produces no N A D P H, ‘but proton-pumping and AT P formation do"
"occur, this is termed cyclic photaphosphorylation. See Fig. 14b."

"The dark phase of photosynthesis differs between so-called C, and"
"C, plants. In the former (including most temperate plants), carbon"
dioxide is fixed by the enzyme ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/
"oxidase (Rubisco), acting as a carboxylase. The two substrates are"
"CO, and ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP), and the product is the 3-"
"carbon (hence C,) compound 3-phosphoglyceric acid (P GA). P GA is"
"not energetic enough for further metabolism, but is converted using"
ATP and N A D PH from the light phase to ‘glyceraldehyde-3-
phosphate. This can be used to recycle RuBP (the canvin CY c tz)
"to ‘synthesize starch, or sucrose. If Rubisco functions as an oxidase"
"then RuBP serves as a substrate for PHOTORESPIRATION, and"
photosynthesis is less — efficient.

"In C, plants (e.g. many cereals and the rice grass Spartinu), the"
"first product of CO,-fixation is 4-carbon oxaloacetate, produced by"
"phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (P E P carboxylase), which uses"
phosphoenolpyruvate as its other substrate. In this Hafch-Slack path
"way, oxaloacetate is further reduced to malate or changed by addition"
of an amino group to aspartate. These reactions occur in mesophyll
"cells of the leaf, and the malate (or aspartate) moves from them to"
bundle-sheath cells surrounding the vascular bundles (see xrawrz
"ana TOMY). Here malate is decarboxylated to yield CO, and pyru-"
"vate, the CO, entering the Calvin cycle as substrate for RuBP-car-"
boxylase while the pyruvate reacts with AT P to form more PEP
molecules. Such plants can generally photosynthesize at — temperatures

PoLymorpuism. Major category . of discontinuous VARIATION
within species. (1) Genetic polymorphism. Simultaneous occurrence in
a species populatipn of two or more discontinuous forms in such a
"ratio that the, rarest of them could not be maintained solely by"
recurrent mutation. This excludes reproductively non-overlapping
"seasonal forms of a species (e.g. some PLEIOMORPHISMS), rare"

polymorphisms generally involve clear genetic alternatives between
"individuals in. the population, .as controlled by s u rer ¢ en es, IN"
v er ston s of loci where allelic substitutions tend to bring about
marked differences in phenotype (so-called ‘major genes’). + Examples
"include many forms of Batesian mmmrcry, human BLoop GRoups,"

"the mac system, some forms of ‘iypusrrra, meLanrsm and"
"HETEROSTYLY, and many forms of sex pzvermrnatron. En-"

The term balanced polymorphism describes polymorphism maintained
by a balance of selective agencies whose effects tend to cancel cach

459. POLYSEPALOUS

 

"Tetraploidycan arise in otherwise normal diploid somatic tissue, both"
"plant and animal, through failure of replicated chromosomes to separate"
inMITOSIS. This can be induced artificially by exposure to a compound
"suchas colchicine, which inhibits formation of the spindle apparatus in"
"mitosis through its disruptive effect upon microtubule formation, or by"
heat treatment. Such AUTOPOLYPLOID cells are much more likely to
"become part of the germ line in plants than in animals, but there maybe"
some reduction in fertility due to unequal segregation of chromosomes
"at meiosis. However, some autotetraploid plants (e.g. cocksfoot grass,"
"Dactylisglomerata; purple loosestrife, Lythrum salicana) ate fully fertile."
ALLOPOL YP Lor D organisms ate more likely to be fully fertile since
each chromosome has only one fully homologous partner to pair with.
-« Grossing and-backcrossing between-these
individuals often produces a polyploid complex; resulting in gene
INTROGRESSION. Most instances of plant APOMIXIS involve poly-
"ploid_species, giving them, an ‘escape from sterility’. Polyploidy is"
"comparatively rare in animals, probably because most animals are"
bisexual and obligate cross-fertilizers. A tetraploid (4m) animal could
only hybridize with diploids and then only ‘produce sterile triploid-
"(3n) offspring, if any at all: Only a few amphibians and fish among"
"vertebrates seem to be polyploid, possibly because of their method of"
SEXDETERMINATION. See also HYBRIDIZATION.

"In plants, the range of variation is often narrower in allotetraploids"
than in a elated diploid because each gene is duplicated. Polyploids
"are often selfpollinated, even when related diploids are mainly cross-"
"pollinated, which reinforces the decrease in variability."

Polyploids are of interest because of the examples they may provide
"of “instantaneous’ § p E © 1A TION, and have been extremely important"
"in the evolution of certain groups of plants. One of the most import,"
"ant polyploid (hexaploid) species is wheat, eg. bread “wheat, Triticum"
"aestivum, which has 42 chromosomes. It was derived some 8000 years"
ago following the spontaneous hybridization of a cultivated wheat
possessing 28 chromosomes with a grass of the same group with 14
"chromosomes, followed by chromosome doubling."

"Among plant polyploids are many of our most important crops,"
"including, besides wheat, bananas, cotton, potatoes, sugar cane and"
"tobacco. Many garden flowers are polyploids, e.g. chrysanthemums,"
"daylilies. See ENDOMITOSIS, POLYTENY."

RECEPTOR (SENSE CELL). Cell responding to some variable feature
of an animal’s internal or external environment by a shift in its
"*membrane voltage. Sometimes, as in primary receptors, only part of"
the cell is sensory and generates action potentials with a frequency
"related to the stimulus intensity; the rest of the cell is axonal,"
transmitting signals long distances. In secondary _receptors_(e.g.
MUSCLE spinpizs) the altered membrane voltage initiates action
potentials in a synapsing neurone by bringing about voltage changes
"(receptor, ot generator potentials) in the postsynaptic membrane of"
the neurone. In all receptors the signal is transduced into electrical
form. Receptors may be intereceptors or exteroceptors and classified
"by modality into chemoreceptors, mechanoreceptors, photoreceptors,"

clear which aspect of phenotype was being described as recessive.

485 RECOMBINATION

 

RecomBinant DNA. DNA whose nucleotide sequence has undergone
"alteration as a result of incorporation of, or exchange with, another"
‘DNA strand. Such DNA occurs naturally as a result of CROSSING-
"OVER during RECOMBINATION, and also during recombinant DNA"
techniques employed during GENE MANIPULATION.

"RECOMBINATION. Any process, other than point mutation, by which"
an organism produces cells with gene combinations different from
any it inherited. Offspring resulting from such recombmant cels are
"recombinant offspring. A major source of GENETIC VARIATION, its"
"effectiveness is dependent upon mutation for initial gene differences,"
from which recombmation events can generate further gene rearrange
ments.

"(1) In meiosis (eukaryotes only), two , kinds of recombination"
between chromosomes commonly occur. Free combination or reassort-
ment (not always regarded as recombination) occurs when non-homo-
logous chromosomes assort randomly to form the two haploid
"nuclei during anaphase of the first meiotic division. As a result, if"
"N = the number of chromosome pairs in the parent cell, each chromo"
"some pair being heterozygous at least at one locus, then the number"
"of possible nuclear genotypes from the first division is 2%, and this in"
the absence of crossing-over. Non-random (restricted) recombination
(the most usual sense of *recombination’) results from crossing-over
"between homologous chromosomes during first meiotic prophase,"
producing recombinant DNA. This is non-random in the sense that

‘it only occurs between homologous sequences of DNA (and non-

"- randomly then; see CROSSING-OVER, SYNAPTONEMAL COM-"
P LE x): @) The process involved m most exchanges of D N A between
"chromosomes, including prokaryotic (see SEXUAL REPRODUC-"
Ti ON). Termed reciprocal recombination when equivalent lengths of
DNA are reciprocally exchanged between duplexes (i.e. between
"double helices), and non-reciprocal recombination (see GENE CON -"
"VERSION) when only one duplex retains its original length, as often"
"happens in the immediate vicinity of crossovers (hence restricted,"
"since crossovers themselves are of limited occurrence). In one model,"
homologous duplex DNA sequences first align themselves side-by-
side; one strand of each duplex is then cut (nicked) by an enzyme and
its broken ends joined up with their opposite partners by a DNA
"ligase (ie. not merely rejomed again as before), to form two homolog-"
ous duplexes whose nucleotide sequences have been altered. See
"recA, reCB and recc."

In bacterial TRANSFORMATION and TRANSDUCTION (examples
"of homologous recombination) and some eukaryotic gene transfers,"
"homologous DNA duplexes first align, the donor duplex undergoes"
"DENATURATION (separates into its two strands), and one strand"
"invades the host duplex, aligning with the host strand having the"
greater base-pairing conformity. [t is then nicked while the host

"strand without a partner is nicked at two places, donor DNA getting"
"inserted by ligases in its place. The evidence. for this comes, from"

MANIPULATION.

"During the generation of J ANTIBODY, DiveRsity during BCELL"
"maturation, genes from different parts of a.chromosome are brought"
together in. such a way that an RNA transcript is produced which

effectively ‘omits’ the intervening DNA _ sequences.

REGeneRATION. Rkstoration by regrowth of parts of body which
have beerk removed, as by injury or AUTOTOM Y. Commoner in
lower thai’ higher animals, but extensive in some planarians (where
new individuals’ can be regenerated from small body fragments), in
the polychaete Chaetopterus (which can regenerate a whole animal
from one segment.) and in crustaceans (which can replace limbs) and
echinoderms (which replace arms). Involves the re-establishment of
local tissue differentiation. Some examples require long-range inter-

*actions and extensive cell movement (morphallaxis), while others involve
short-range interactions and ‘extensive growth epimorphosis). _—_Verte-
brate embryonic limb regeneration involves production of a BL a s ~
TEMA. If a large part of an organ is removed (e.g. of liver, pancreas)
the remaining organ commonly returns to normal size. This is corn-

"female gametophyte generation dependent on water for fertilization,"
and its retention within the tissues of the spordphyte by which it 1s
protected and supplied with food. It occurred early in geological
"history, and in more than one group of plants. Of equal importance"
was the reduction of the-male gametophyte to the pollen grain and its
"pollen tube, again avoiding the need for water in fertilization. Inde-"
pendence from water in sexual reproduction increased immensely — the
range of environments open for colonization. Biological advantages
of the seed habit include: continued protection and nutrition of the

SPECIALIZED. Having special adaptations to a particular ecological

niche which often result in wide divergence from the presumed

: ancestral form. Such specializations evolve and may result in niche te-
striction.

Speciation. The origin of spzczzs. If species are not real
"(‘objective’) entities, speciation cannot be regarded as a real process."
"If, however, speeies .are lineages with temporal continuity, then"

~ speciation is whatever generates independence of lineages from one
other. °

The major models of speciation are the allopatric and sympatric
models. In the former a parent species- becomes physically separated
"into daughter populations by geography, restricting (or — eliminating)"
gene flow between non-overlapping populations. In sympatric
"models, a parent species differentiates into lineages in the absence of"
any physical restriction on gene flow.

Some phenotypic characters bear directly on speciation. Shape of
"genital aperture, timing of breeding, degree of assortative mating,"
"compatibility of pollen and stigma, degree of developmental homeo-"
stasis — all are aspects of phenotype subject to genetic variation. They
"are therefore responsive to disruptive or directional selection, and"

can alter cohesion of the population as an evolutionary unit or
"lineage. Debate surrounds whether speciation is adaptive, or merely a"
stochastic process which perhaps selection cannot prevent. Allopatric
"speciation, at least, seems to involve non-selective splitting of lineages."
"In time, the daughter populations may simply gain ~ sufficient"
distinctive genetic and phenetic characteristics for taxonomists to
tecognize separate species. Sympatric speciation models more often
invoke the adaptrveness of species formation But some insist that in
either model speciation is de jure incomplete until sufficient overlap-
ping of daughter populations has occurred for the biological species

"concept to be applied. It is often said that after overlap, selection"
against hybrids either reinforces lineage independence or 1s too weak
#NAME?
"the speciesconcept, phenetic or biological, being employed."

Major sympatric models involve disruptive selection on a deme
"already polymorphic for an ecological requirement (eg. food  -plant,"

"oviposition site), and assortative mating in favour of individuals ;"
sharing that requirement. Its occurrence in the wild is slowly gaining
", acceptance."

Stasipatric speciation postulates that a widespread species may
generate internal daughter ‘ species whose chromosomal rearrange-
ments play ‘a primary role in speciation (through reduced fecundity

.. oryiability _ of: individuals heterozygous .. for the rearrangements)...
Daughter species might then extend their ranges at the expense of the
"parent species and might hybridize where ranges abut, although"
resulting offspring would-be less __ fertile.

"Polyploidy can be a form of ‘instantaneous’ speciation, since it may"
result in the complete reproductive isolation of an individual from
"other gene. pools. Allopolyploids are, more significant here than"
"autopolyploids, permitting regular bivalent formation during meiosis"
as well as originating through combination of genomes from different
"species. They breed tre for their hybrid character, Moreover, crosses"
"of -allotetraploids. to their diploid progenitors .give sterile triploids,"
preventing backcrossing and gene flow. They: are widespread . in
"plants4 where, vegetative propagation of sterile. hybrids can enhance"
"colonization prior to allopolyploidy, successful meiosis and improved"
fertility. SeerpoLyPLorpy. .

Debate surrounds the role of speciation in phyletic. (macro- Jevolu-
"tion. Apart from stasipatric and polyploid speciation, there“ are no"
clear accounts of the genetics of speciation.

Species. Term used both of a formal taxonomic category (‘the
species’) and of taxa exemplifying it (particular species). In the
"system of BINOMIAL NOMENCLATURE, taxa with species status are"
"denoted by Latin binomials, each species being a member of a genus."
"The naturalist John Ray, writing of plants in 1672, did not entirely"
avoid circularity in stating that the’true criterion of species as taxa is
that they are ‘never born from the seed ‘of another species and
reciprocally’: the cross-sterility criterion. To a special creationist like
Ray such cross-sterility was to be expected (compare the nominalism
"of 8 vrron). For Darwin, all degrees of sterility should be discover"
"able if sterility barriers (the quite different, evolutionary, concept of"
ISOLATING MECHANISMS) taketime to evolve. See SPECIATION.

Darwin’s writings sometimes reveal nominalism on the species ques-
"tion, to be expected on the view that species evolve gradually- ‘At"
"other times he drew a clear distinction between faxa and categories,"
and although doubtful about the possibility of defining the category

“species” (i.e. the taxonomic unit) he was in no doubt that taxa with
specific status actually existed. He did riot espouse zs sz nT tat is

‘ Zoologists find: the criterion of ‘reproductive isolation especially
"valuable in demarcating species in the wild As such, the biological"
species concept includes as + species groups of populations which ‘are
phenotypically similar and reproductively isolated from other such
"groups, but which are actually ‘or potentially capable of interbreeding"
among themselves. Problems in its application arise (a) when re-
"productive isolation from other populations admits of degrees, being"
"incomplete over part of a species range, (b) with e ING Sez c us, (c)"
"with obligately asexual species (agamospecies), (d} with animals which"

"-—_—-—altheugh—sexual lack -males-(ebligate-THELY FOKY),-and (ce) with —_—_——"

ana ce ne $1. The biological species concept also fails to incorporate
"a historical dynamic into its account, thereby ignoring that species"
are genealogically unique. The majority of fungi; plants and marine
"invertebrates broadcast their gametes widely, making it impossible to"
establish reproductive isolation in the wild. So complexes of phenetic
characters (the stock-in-trade of museum taxonomists} usually serve
"to’ identify such species. But ste.inc sezcres pose problems, and"
classification rests here upon cytological techniques (eg. use of DNA
"probes) rather than external morphology, although reproductive —_ isola-"
tion is often the original clue to their existence.

Recently favour has developed for ecological and evolutionary
species concepts. The former fix a classification to independently
existing environmental states or niches (difficult to isolate independ-
"ently of the organisms which occupy them), equating speciation with"

. niche change but leaving open the extent. of change required: the

latter stress the genealogical uniqueness of species (useful in
"asexual and thelytokous forms), but emphasize the cladistic (branch-"
ing) nature of speciation at the expense of gradual anagenesis. Most
species probably comprise two or more subspecies of races (see
"INFRASPECIFIC variaTIon, SEMISPECIES) and are said to be"
poly ty pie.

"Inability to find a unified species concept is no disgrace, reflecting"
the variety of reproductive systems and the dynamic state of biologi-
cal material. It isprobably no accident that the species concept does
not figure prominently in biological theory: species may be best
regarded not as NaTurat KI NDS (such as elements in chemistry)
"but as individuals, each historically unique and -irreplaceable once"
extinct. If species are individuals then species names are proper
"names, so that properties of species would describe but not define"
them. Definitions of taxa would then be necessary in philosophical
"terms, even though there is no list of necessary properties for any"
biological taxon. See cransrrrviry.

Saquamata. Order of the reprrtza (Subclass Lepidosauria) contain-
"ing lizards (Lacertilia), snakes (Ophidia), amphisbaenids (Am-"
phisbaenia) and the tuataa (x y n CHo c ee wat Ia). Males generally

"have unique paired copulatory organs. In lizards, mandibles are"
"joined at a symphysis but, as in snakes, there is a freely movable"
"quadrate bone to which lower jaw is hinged., Snakes lack eardrums"
and movable eyelids and their cyes are covered by transparent eyelids.
The jaws are exceptionally mobile and only loosely attached to the
skull; mandibles are only loosely attached anteriorly by elastic _liga-
"ments and laterally by skin and muscles, with great telative mobility."
Snakes feeding on prey large enough to struggle are usually con-
"strictors (e.g. boas, pythons, anacondas) or venomous (e.g. cobras,"
"mambas, coral and sea snakes, pit vipers and true vipers). The group"

mersion in a stain solution. Vital staining refers to staming of living
tissue when no damage to the tissue occurs (e.g. neutral red stains
"vacuoles and granules in many cells, Janus green stains mitochondria"
specifically). Non-vital staining refers to the staining of dead tissue.
Various modified techniques are required for staining different types
"of tissues for light microscopy, e.g. counterstaining (double _ staining),"
where two stains are used in sequence so as to stan different parts of
"«the specimen. See DEHYDRATION, FIXATION."

"Staining techniques may give quantitative data, as when the amount"
"of stain taken up is proportional to the amount of stained component,"
and methods exist (microspectrophotometry) to measure through the
microscope the amount of stain present at a given site within a cell.

Stains in electron microscopy are not the coloured stains of light
"microscopy; rather they contain heavy metal atoms (e.g. lead,"
uranium) infotms that combine with chemical groups characteristic
of specific structures in the cell. Presence of such atoms permits fewer
"electrons to pass through the specimen, so that an image is produced."
‘Stained’ (electron-dense) structures appear darker than their sur-
roundings. Negative staining for electron microscopy is used to
examine three-dimensional and surface aspects of cell structure. Speci-
mens are not sectioned; rather they are placed directly on a thin
"plastic film, covered with a drop of solution containing heavy metal"
"atoms and allowed to dry, leaving the specimen with a thin layer of"
electron-dense material.

T-ceLt (T-LympHocyte). Lymphocytes which travel from the bone
"marrow via the blood and enter the thymus, after which they enter"
the circulation again and settle in spleen-and lymph nodes. While in
the thymus a T-cell ‘learns’ during T-cell maturation both to treat its
body’s Class I molecules as ‘selftantigens’ and to recognize as foreign
a specific EPITOPE of a ‘non-self antigen’ when this is bound to
M WC molecules (termed MHC restriction). T-cells do not produce
"antibody, but antibody production by B-cells often requires T-cell"
help. A Thelper cell (Ty) tecognizes a specific antigen on an antigen-
"presenting cell, binds to it, and then assists a B-cell binding the same"
antigen to proliferate into specific antibody-secreting cells. + Cytotoxic
T-cells (Tc) recognize tumour or virus-infected cells by their surface
"antigens in‘combination with their M H C markers, and will kill them."
Other T-cells (macrophage-activating cells) produce 1 y M PH OKINES
which promote macrophage activity. Suppressor T-cells (Ts) specifi-
"cally suppress the immune response, probably through affecting"
antigen-presenting cells and/or through more direct interactions
with Ty or B-cells. See Fig. 41.

Teteotoay. Biological discourse becomes teleological when reference
"is made to function, purpose and design, as when structure is related"
"to- function. In recent history, vitalists, organismic biologists and"
others have stressed that biological systems demand a functional
"interpretation, but tended to explain this goal-directedness or adapted-"
ness by a retroactive (teleological) causation peculiar to living systems
"‘pulling’ = towards perfection. As Aristotle probably intimated, and we"
"tend to believe, the goal-directedness of the vast bulk of biological"
"structure-and behaviour is more easily interpreted as the outcome, or"
"expression, of an organizational complexity far greater than that of"
"normal inert objects. It is largely attributable to parwim that, since"
"the mid 19th century, an account of adaptation has been available"
which trivializes classical teleology and interprets contexts in which
teleological terms are used as inevitable consequences of biological
"reproduction, accompanied as that is by selective transmission of"
heritable variation from one generation to the next as organisms
compete for finite environmental resources. The concept of teleology
"is difficult to explicate without circularity. See FuNcTION, PROXIM-"

The first law of thermodynamics states that in any process the total

Absorption of heat characterizes endothermic reactions. The form of

energy capable of doing work in a system under constant temperature
"and pressure is its free energy (G), whose value is the key to"
predicting the direction of a chemical reaction. These relationships
may be summarized:

AG=AH-TAS

"where AG = the free energy change of the system, AH = its change in"

"enthalpy, 7 = absolute temperature and AS = its change in entropy."
"Reactions are exothermic if AH is negative, endothermic if AH is"
"positive, they are exergonic (and may do work) if AG is negative, and"
endergonic (not doing work) if AG is positive. Spontaneous reactions
are characterized by a loss of free energy (exergonic). Endergonic
reactions cannot proceed spontaneously.

The free energy change of any reaction at constant temperature and
pressure involves a fixed constant for that reaction known as the
"standard free energy change of the reaction (AG), giving the loss of"
free energy when the reaction is allowed to go to equilibum starting
"with certain standard conditions = in particular, when all reactants"
and products are present at 1.0 molar concentrations. It is a measure
of the difference between the sum of fice energies of products and of
"reactants and is related to the equilibrium constant K (since AG, ="
~ RTInK). Free energy of a reaction varies with concentrations of
"reactants and products, affecting its probability of occurrence. A"
"chemical reaction only occurs if its AG is negative in sign, andt+the"
maximum amount of work it then does equals this decrease in free

energy. >

Transcription Factors. Regulatory proteins determining the effi-

regions during transcription. Transcription activators are involved in
"positive, and transcription repressors in negative control of gene"
expression. The DNA-binding ability of these proteins often com-
"prises the common structural motif of an a-helix, a short turn anda"
second a-helix (the “helix-turn-helix’). The first helix interacts with
the DNA backbone while the second lies in a major groove of the
DNA molecule. Many eukaryotic transcription factors contain in
addition tandemly repeated amino acid sequences each producing a
metal-binding (often Zn+*) finger-like protrusion in the functional
molecule. These finger sequences (multifinger loops) often include
identical or near-identical (consensus) sub-sequences which are
thought to be conserved and homologous. Several eukaryotic trans-

the season and stage of development. Rates of movement in phloem
‘(W-120 cm h-'): greatly exceed normal sucrose diffusion rates in

from source to sink along an osmotic turgor pressure ‘gradient. In
"leaves (the source), sugars are actively secreted into sieve tubes and"
"absorbed there by companion cells, while at the sink (e.g. roots)"
"they are absorbed by parenchyma cells, all of which causes m ass"
"FLow in the intervening sieve-tube, which in this hypothesis plays"
a purely passive role throughout. Physical models suggest that
pressure-flow could produce the flow rates observed with radio-
"labelled sugars, and at the pressures detected within sieve-tubes, but"
only on the improbable view that most of the pores in sieve-plates
are unblocked during translocation. Some support the view that
"phloem is involved actively in translocation, maybe through a form"

TRANSPOSITION, TRANSPOSON.

Transpositions. Phenomena in which genetic elements insert and
excise themselves from chromosomal and plasmid DNA. ‘Those that
can replicate independently of the host genome or plasmid are
termed episomal (e.g. prophages and temperate viruses); those with-
out their own replication origin are termed. TRANSPOSABLE
ELEMENTS .

Transposon. A genetic element, varying from 750 base pairs to 40
kilobase (kb) pairs in length, having at least the genes necessary for
‘its own transposition (movement from a site in one genome to
another site in the same or in a different genome). Simple transposons
 

 

TRANSVERSE PROCESS 566

 

(INSERTION SEQUENCES) carry this information alone; complex
transposons house additional genes, such as ANTIB IOTIC RESIST-
ANCE steMenrs. Many if not all encode the enzyme transposase
which facilitates their insertion, although its level may be kept low in
the host cell by repression from a (reselvase) gene also carried on the
transposon. In simple transposition, the transposon is moved to the
new DNA site but leaves a lethal gap in the old DNA; in replicative
transposition the transposon is replicated so that one copy is left in
situ while the other is moved to a new DNA site. Replicative
transposition offen requires the enzyme resolvase. See m ans POS «
ABLEELEMENTS.

TRANSVERSE process. Lateral projection, one on each side, of

 

neural atch of tetrapod vertebra, with which the head of the nib arficu-

Mouth and gut are retained, adults having a thick epidermal cuticle.
All have a sucker around mouth. Adult digeneans live in liver, gut,
lung or blood vessel of primary host and may cause serious disease
(see scutsrosgma). Ciliated larvae (miracidia) pass out of the host
with, egesta and parasitize snails ‘(secondary host) in which they
reproduce “asexually (see » 01 em BR ¥ 0 wy). Sporocysts then give
rise toREDIAE and these to .CERCARIAE. Monogeneans normally
have a large multiple central sucker for attachment, Polystomun
alone among them being endoparasitic (frog bladder).

nephridia may be present.

TROPHIC Lever. Theoretical term in ecology. One of a succession of
steps in the transfer of matter and energy through a c 0 « ww 1 ry,
as may be *brought about by such events as grazing, predation,
parasitism, decomposition, etc. (see Foon cuarw). For theoretical
and heuristic purposes, organisms are often treated as occupying the
same trophic level when the matter and energy they contain have
passed through the same number of steps (1c. organisms) since their
fixation in photosynthesis. Primary producers; herbivores, primary,
secondary and tertiary carnivores and decomposers all commonly
figure as trophic levels in the analysis of ecosystems. Different develop-
mental stages and/or sexes within a species may occur in more than
one trophic level. The number of trophic levels in a community is
thought to be limited by inefficiency in snercy rrow from one
trophic level to the next; however, food chains are no longer in
tropical communities, where energy input is high, than they are in
Arctic communities, where energy input is low.

TROPHOBLAST. Epithelium surrounding the mammalian = 1 as +
vo Cyst, forming outer layer of chorion and becoming part of the
embryonic component of the p LACENTA oz of the ExTRa-gMBRY »

TROPICAL Rain Forest. Forests found in three major regions of the
world. Largest, is in the Amazon basin of South America, with
extensions into coastal Brazil, Central America, eastern Mexico and

some islands in the West Indies; the second is in the Zaire basin of
Africa, with an extension along the Liberian coast; the third extends
from Sri Lanka and eastern India to Thailand, the Philippines, the
large islands of Malaysia and a narrow strip along the north-east
coast of Queensland in Australia. Neither water nor low temperatures
are limiting factors for photosynthesis, and rainfall averages from
 

571 TRYPSIN

 

200-400 cm. yr-1. It is the richest biome in terms of both plant-and

animal diversity. The trees are evergreen, characterized by large
leathery leaves. There is a poorly developed herbaceous layer on the
forest floor because of low light levels, but there are many vines, and

epiphytes at higher levels. Many of the animals inhabit tree tops.

Little accumulation of organic debris occurs because decomposers

rapidly break it down, released nutrients being quickly absorbed by
mycorrhizal roots or leached from the soil by rain (very little in
undamaged forest). Tropical rain forest now forms about half -the
forested area of the planet, but is in process of being destroyed by

human activities. Many of the soils of tropical rain forests are condi-
tioned by high and constant temperatures and ‘abundant rainfall and
nutrients): When the forest is -cleared, this leaching process accelerates
and the soils either erode or form thick, impenetrable crusts on-which

cultivation is impossible. It is estimated that by the end of this

century most of the tropical rain forests (with huge’ untapped genetic

resources) will have disappeared to produce fields which will be

completely useless to agriculture within a very few years and then
turn to desert, with considerable effect on global climate.

UNITMEMBRANE. See CELL MEMBRANES .

Unit oF setection. Whatever it is that waruran setecrron dis-
criminates between, and whose frequencies in populations may
thereby be altered. Controversy surrounds thjs issue. Strong initial
contenders for such units are individual organisms themselves. How-
ever, since selection discriminates between these on the grounds of
phenotype, and since total phenotype is not what sexual reproduction
reproduces, phenotypic characters themselves might better qualify as
-units of selection, individual organisms being composites of character
traits. Strictly, however, it is usually not traits but their material
causes (physical encodings, cenzs) which pass from parent to off-
spring in reproduction. Yet if selection acts at the level of classical
Mendelian genes, many of which are pleiotropic, then as dominance
relations between genetically determined characters are subject to
background genetic modifiers, genetic backgrounds as much as in-
dividual alleles (altemative genes at a locus} may qualify as units of
selection. However, alleles themselves may not be durable enough to
be the units, since crossing-over, when it occurs, normally does so
within genes. Instead, the genetic unit favoured by selection may
simply be any length of DNA which persists in tact through a greater
than average number of metoses. But a mutant molecular ‘tick’ (eg.
cen ge COn Ver SIO -w) producing such better-than-average persistence
would tend to be favoured automatically by selection, thereby disrupt-
ing the normal control selection exerts on genotype via expression of
mutants in the phenotype: for such a mutant might have no pheno-
typic effect at all. In conclusion, a plurality of entities may qualify as
units of selection, producing a range between neo-classical Mendelian
genes and-‘selfish’ DNA. See rrevess, azrrursm.

"flight. In fish, gill ventilation ig achieved’ using a pressure pump ‘in"
front and a suction pump behind. Amphibians at rest on land
"employ throat movements, to renew air in the mouth, where gaseous"
"exchange occurs; when active, a buccal force-pump ventilates the"
"Jungs, possibly assisted by flank movements. Bird ventilation is very"

complex.(see AIR $4.C8). Only mammals have a DIAPHRAGM (stimu-—__

which they are obligate parasites and outside of which they are inert.
"Pass through filters which trap bacteria, and resolvable only by"
electron microscopy. Not normally regarded as ‘living’ since none
"has any enzyme activity away from its host. When inside a cell, may"
pack- together in a crystalline condition through symmetry and teg-
"ularity of their capsids. They are biological systems, since each"
contains molecular information in the form of nucleic acid (but
"unlike cells, never both DNA and “RNA), transcribed and replicated"
within the host cell. The fully formed virus particle (virion) contains
its nucleic acid or nucleoprotein core either within a naked coat of
protein (capsid) consisting of protein subunits (capsomeres) or within
a capsid enveloped by one or more host cell membranes acquired
"‘during exit from the cell and often modified, as by addition of"
specific glycoproteins. Capsid symmetry may be helical (capsomeres
"forming a rod-shaped helix around the nucleic acid core, eg. tobacco"
"mosaic virus, TM V) or icosahedral (spherical, capsomeres forming a"
"20-sided structure), capsomere number ranging from 12 (@X174) to"
252 (adenovirus). Some viruses (phages) infect fungi (mycophages) ot
bacteria (BACTERIOPHAGE ‘*S) .

Viruses may be classified in terms of the type of nucleic acid core
they contain. In RNA viruses this may be either single-stranded
"(e.g. picornaviruses, causing polio and the common cold) or double-"
"stranded (e.g. reovirus, causing diarrhoea); likewise DN A viruses"
(e.g. single-stranded in gX174 phage and parvovirus; double-
"stranded in adenovirus, herpesvirus and poxvirus). RNA viruses are"
"of three main types: + strand RN A viruses, whose genome serves as"
mR N A in the host cell and serves as template for a minus ( — )
"strand RN A intermediate; ~ strand RNA viruses, which cannot"
serve directly as mR NA but rather as templates for mRN A_ synthesis
"via a Virion transcriptase; and retroviruses, which are + strand and"
can serve as mRN As but on infection immediately act as templates

core into the cell. Some viruses (e.g. poliovirus) have receptor sites on
"specific host cells which enable entry. Once inside, the genome is"
commonly initially transcribed by_host enzymes; but
"enzymes usually, then take over. Host cell synthesis is generally shut"
"down, the viral genome replicated, and capsomeres synthesized prior"
to assembly. into mature virions (see seLr-assemBry). The virus
"commonly enaodes a late-produced enzyme,rupiuring the host plasma"
membrane *(the lytic :phase) to release the infective progeny; but a
viral ‘genome may become integrated into the host chromosome -and
be replicated along with it (a provirus). Many eukaryotic genomes

"formation of the cell (S€e€ oncocEMz, CANCER CELL) through"
synthesis of proteins normally produced only during viral multiplica-

Water potentiaL. Term indicating the net tendency of any system
"to donate water to its surroundings. The water potential, p,, of a"
"plant cell is the algebraic sum of its wall pressure (pressure potential),"
"Wp, and of its osmotic (solute) potential,, yo;"

Yo = Up + bo

Since the water potential of pure water at atmospheric pressure is
"zero pressure units by definition, any addition of solute to pure water"
reduces its water potential and makes its value negative: Water
movement in nature is therefore always from ‘a system with higher
(less negative) water potential to one ‘with lower (more negative)
water potential. The units normally employed are megapascals (MPa;
______ direction i _n— which_water.

 

WATER VASCULAR SYSTEM 592

 

"1 Pa= 1 Newton/m?), or millibars (1 mbar = 10? Pa). Standard"
"atmospheric pressure, equal to the average pressure of air at sea"
"level, is 1.01 bar."

The term has wide applicability. The water potential of any cell is its
"net tendency to donate water to its surroundings, one with a higher"
water potential than an adjacent cell tending to donate water to it.
Plant cells in equilibrium with pure water have zero water potential
and will be fully turgid. The volume of water entering or leaving a
plant cell during equilibrium attainment is negligible and does not
alter the cell’s solute potential.

When applied to non-cellular systems such as solutions separated
"by a_ selectively permeable membrane, water potentials dictate the net"

water is always from higher to lower water potential values. Osmotic
effects can therefore be subsumed under the wider category of water
"potential effects,. for membranes may or may not be involved in"
phenomena explained in terms of water potential. It is therefore
"valuable in predicting ‘water movement between cells, between cells"
and soil solutions and between cells and the atmosphere. It reduces
to one the number of units employed.in analysing the TRANSPIRA-
TION STREAM in plants. Compare osmosis.

WATER vascutan system. System of water-filled canals forming
"tubular component of echinoderm coelom, usually with direct connec-"
"tion (the madreporite) with the exterior, A  circumoesophageal water"
"ring internal _ to the skeleton. usually gives off radial water, canals"
which pass through pores in the skeleton wherever tube-feet protrude.
Each tube-foot is expanded by a muscular ampulla internal to the
skeleton and is cooordinated with others in feeding and locomotion.
See TUBE-FEET.

Waxes. Fatty acid esters of alcohols with high molecular weights.
"Occur as protective coatings of arthropod cur I C 1s, skin, fur, feath-"
"ers, leaves and fruits, often reducing water loss. Also found in"
beeswax and lanolin. ”

W-cHromosome. An alternative notation for the Y-chromosome in
organisms where the heterogametic sex is female. See sexe HROMO+
SOME.

Weeos. Plants growing where they are not wanted; compete for
"space, light, water and nutrients with garden or crop plants. Many"
"adapted to exploit disturbed land, often being the first to colonize"
waste ground (when they may be beneficial by preventing soil eros-
"ion). Tend to produce vast numbers of seeds/fruits per plant, these"
"being easily and widely disseminated, often remaining dormant until"
"rapid growth and further seed production occur. Annuals, biennials"
"and perennials, they often provide habitats for insect and fungal pests."
Leguminous weeds can add nitrogen to the soil through N-fixing

"Xeropuyte. Plant of arid habitat, able to endure conditions of"
"prolonged drought (eg. in » ESERTS), due either to a capacity during"
"the brief rainy season’for intemal water storage, used when none can"
"be obtained from the soil, plus low daytime transpiration rates"
associated with stomatal closure (eg. in such succulents as cacti) or
ability to recover from partial desiccation (e.g. such desert shrubs as
"the creosote bush). As long as water is freely available, it seems that"
"non-succulent xerophytes transpire as much as, or more freely than,"
mesophytes but unlike the latter they can endure periods of perma-
